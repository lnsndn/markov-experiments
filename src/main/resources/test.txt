BEGIN HERE In October of 2012, Elizabeth Gordon and Kenneth Sicard's mutual friends set the pair up on a blind date. "By the end of the night we both knew it was the start of something really special," Elizabeth remembers. "Kenny's sweet dance moves sealed the deal for me and he says my smile and jokes did it for him." As excited as they were about the prospects for a relationship, Elizabeth still had her doubts: At the time, she was battling cancer and caring for her daughter, Anslie, on her own. "I thought those sort of things would send a guy running for the hills," she says. But Kenny wasn't going anywhere and even told Elizabeth that the things she feared would drive him away only made him love her more. Three months later, she introduced Anslie and Kenny to each other and their instant bond was proof enough that he was here to stay. END
BEGIN HERE About a year and a half later, Kenny popped the question in the kitchen of their apartment. "Anslie ran into the room wondering what was going on," the bride says. "She then burst into tears, hugged us both, and said, 'This is the best day of my life!'" And it only got better for her: Kenny left the room and reappeared with another box, this time dropping to one knee to ask Anslie if he could be her step dad with a pair of earrings. END
BEGIN HERE The couple (and Anslie!) decided to officially become a family on October 3, 2015, at the Muscadine Vine in Powder Springs, Georgia. With a relaxed, natural, and ethereal aesthetic in mind, Elizabeth and Kenny invited 120 guests to watch them exchange vows and asked Julia Fenner of Leggy Bird to capture their gorgeous fall day. Even with less-than-perfect weather, this happy couple and their young daughter made it a day to remember. END
BEGIN HERE "I cried the first time we checked out our venue," Elizabeth admits. "We referred to it as 'The Secret Garden.' It was every bit whimsical and breathtaking and we instantly knew it was where we were supposed to pledge our love and officially start our lives together." Although their October wedding date came with some unexpected rainy weather, it only proved to make the day that much more intimate and magical. END
BEGIN HERE Elizabeth found her lace and chiffon wedding dress from Free People on a whim. "I was casually browsing their new bridal collection and I instantly knew this was the one," she says. "When my dress arrived, it felt like Christmas morning. After that, everything else started falling into place. My dress set the romantic tone for our wedding." END
BEGIN HERE Her fresh floral headpiece, which contained a mix of different flowers including hydrangeas, roses, and greenery, complemented Elizabeth's soft waves. Anslie coordinated with her mom by wearing a full flower crown, filled with lots of greenery and hydrangeas. The bride also donned a long veil handmade by her groom's aunt. END
BEGIN HERE "We decided to go with very neutral colors for our wedding party," Elizabeth says, so she asked her bridesmaids to choose any cream-hued lace dress they loved. While the bride's bouquet featured lots of bright-hued blooms, including roses, hydrangeas, berries, and eucalyptus, her attendants carried arrangements comprised entirely of greenery. "They looked amazing with their cream dresses and the landscaping." END
BEGIN HERE When it came to Kenny's attire, he kept everything Southern classic, but with his own modern spin. He paired his blue Michael Kors suit with a traditional white button down and a vintage bow tie from Elizabeth. His groomsmen all wore khaki pants, white shirts, and tan suspenders. END
BEGIN HERE The family's first look was one of the most memorable parts of the day for Elizabeth, Kenny, and Anslie. Kenny stood beneath an oak tree with his back to his future wife and daughter, and the pair snuck up beneath a big umbrella. "We were giggling and failing to be quiet and sneaky," the bride remembers. "When we turned around and we saw one another for the first time... I can't put it into words." END
BEGIN HERE The three enjoyed some private time together, posing for photos and laughing as a family, before the celebration kicked off. END
BEGIN HERE Anslie served as both the flower girl and ring bearer, toting a basket of greenery and lace and wearing the couple's wedding bands on a chain around her neck, over her heart. Musician Anna Kate Gill played guitar and sang for the ceremony. Elizabeth and her father walked down the aisle to a live rendition of Jack Johnson's "Angel." END
BEGIN HERE Although their ceremony was initially meant to be outside, rainy weather meant the reception barn had to serve double duty. Elizabeth's step dad officiated, making the personalized ceremony that much more special for the bride and groom. "It was a really special way of incorporating him into our wedding festivities," she says. "Reading our vows to one another with all of our loved ones surrounding us was magical. We pledged our love in the barn with the rain beating down on the tin roof. It was so intimate and romantic." END
BEGIN HERE The reception featured a collection of antique and eclectic furniture, including mismatched farm tables and a claw foot tub that was repurposed to hold bottles of cold beer. The bride and groom's sweetheart table was decorated with an old wooden trunk and Elizabeth's bold bouquet. END
BEGIN HERE For dinner, the couple brought in a local favorite: Sweet Auburn BBQ dished out southern staples like pulled pork, pulled chicken, boracho, baked beans, mac and cheese, Texas toast, and cornbread. END
BEGIN HERE The meal closed out with an assortment of cupcakes, arranged on an antique shelf. Flavors like chocolate, cookies and cream, red velvet, chocolate cream, blueberry crumble, strawberry, key lime pie, and almond wedding cake meant there was something for everyone to enjoy during dessert. END
BEGIN HERE Elizabeth and Kenny shared their first dance to "Coming Home" by Leon Bridges before bringing their daughter out onto the dance floor with them. "Then, we danced the night away under the twinkling lights, barefoot until my dress turned brown," the bride says. "We loved around and only saw happy faces full of love and laughter." END
BEGIN HERE Although they planned a honeymoon in the Bahamas for early 2016, Elizabeth and Kenny enjoyed a little alone time following their fall nuptials. "The day after the wedding we packed up and headed to our family cabin in the mountains. The first night we made a fire, ate a frozen pizza, drank champagne, and read our cards and guest book. Reflecting on our big day together in that setting was cozy and perfect." END
BEGIN HERE Weddings bring people together. Case in point Michelle and Mike first met at another couple's nuptials in Los Angeles in October of 2012. Two years later, Mike popped the question and the two began planning their own special celebration. They gave themselves exactly one year to plan their celebration at the Bacara Resort and Spa in Santa Barbara, California, setting the date for May 9, 2015, and invited 500 guests to watch to them say "I do". END
BEGIN HERE "We kept coming back to the phrase 'boho black tie,'" Michelle says of their vision for the wedding. "This meant keeping the wedding as relaxed and intimate as possible with our guest list, but also making sure it would turn into a wild dance party post ceremony." Debbie and Paige from Geller Events understood their aesthetic to a T and helped the bride and groom plan a party in shades of earthy neutrals and moody reds and purples — and one where the bulk of the action would take place after dark. Gia Canali documented every moonlit moment of their blowout bash. Read on to see how everything came together! END
BEGIN HERE The Bacara Hotel and Spa afforded the couple out-of-this-world views of the Santa Barbara coastline. In keeping with their elegant-yet-earthy theme, Michelle and Mike decided on formal white invitations paired with an antiqued overlay. END
BEGIN HERE Michelle chose a stunning Inbal Dror lace wedding dress, but further customized the elegant silhouette with a tulle overskirt from Romona Kaveza. She accessorized with a delicate bouquet of Lily of the Valley, her grandmother's vintage purse, earrings borrowed from her mother, and a bracelet on loan from Mike's mom. Her soft waves and natural makeup completed her bridal look. END
BEGIN HERE Mike took note of the couple's black tie vibe and chose a classic tuxedo from Lanvin paired with a bowtie. END
BEGIN HERE The bride asked her eight beautiful bridesmaids to choose any dress they liked for the wedding, as long as it had an earthy vibe. "They're all fashion-aware New York and Los Angeles based girls, so I felt comfortable leaving it up to them," Michelle says. Her faith in their fashion choices was totally understandable — can you believe this gorgeous look was entirely uncoordinated? Each lady carried a matching bouquet of white peonies. END
BEGIN HERE Mike's groomsmen matched the ladies' formality in sharp tuxedos. END
BEGIN HERE The couple's flower girls looked absolutely adorable in floor-length white dresses with lace sleeves. END
BEGIN HERE Since the bride and groom wanted a dreamy, moonlit ceremony and reception, they had plenty of time to take portraits all around the stunning grounds of the Bacara Resort and Spa. END
BEGIN HERE The ceremony was held on the property's lawn. There, rustic chairs were arranged around a wooden aisle that was lined with spirea, all facing a chuppah decorated with deep red peonies, dahlias, and roses. END
BEGIN HERE As night fell, Michelle and Mike's flower girls kicked off the ceremony with their walk down the aisle and it's safe to say the three adorable attendants stole the show. After they made their way to the altar, the bride walked down the aisle with both her mother and father while musicians played instrumental versions of classic rock songs, including "Blackbird," "Forever Young," "I Wanna Hold Your Hand," "Fools Rush In," and "She's Got a Way." END
BEGIN HERE In addition to their traditional Jewish ceremony, the bride and groom shared personalized vows. Once the pair was pronounced husband and wife, a flurry of white flower petals fell across the ceremony. END
BEGIN HERE Guests moved inside for the couple's reception, and while tables were elegantly set with arrangements of dahlias, roses, lavender, and tulips, dinner wasn't served at a set time. Instead, Michelle and Mike chose to have their meal come out over the course of the whole evening so as not to slow down the party mood they were going for. "It definitely had a heavy Mediterranean influence," says Michelle. "My mother personally taught the head chef a signature Persian rice dish that we served." For those that wanted to enjoy a seated meal, decorative white place settings and lots of flowers and candlelight created a cozy atmosphere. END
BEGIN HERE The bride and groom's signature drinks, an Old Fashioned and Cucumber Gin cocktail, were both a hit with guests. END
BEGIN HERE Michelle and Mike made sure their reception was tons of fun with both a live band and a DJ. The party was so much fun, in fact, that it went on well into the next day. "We both come from pretty large, rowdy families so keeping the dancing going until 4 a.m. was pretty indicative of us," the bride says. END
BEGIN HERE "Laugh a lot," Michelle advises future brides. "And don't forget, nobody likes a diva!" END
