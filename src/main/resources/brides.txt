BEGIN HERE Oh, October! This is the time when our Instagram feed is overflowing with everything we all love about this wonderful time of year. From apple picking, pumpkin patches and countless images of fall foliage, there's so much to swoon over — including an all-time favorite of ours, fall wedding photos! We can never get enough, and we know you can't either. So here's our round-up of our favorite photos from real couples who got married this weekend. Want to share your wedding photos from your own big day? Tag #MyBridesMoment for your chance to be featured. Now, onto the photos! END
BEGIN HERE (Above) Wedding bells were ringing this weekend for The Flash actor, Robbie Amell and Designated Survivor actress, Italia Ricci. After 8 years of dating, the duo finally said their "I do's" at a ceremony in Los Angeles, CA. Italia looked über classic in a stunning ball gown wedding dress with her hair simply pulled up and topped off with a sparkly headband. They paused for a quick moment to take in one of the happiest moments on your big day — when you get to make your grand exit as husband and wife! END
BEGIN HERE Introducing Mr. and Mrs. Chinyani! We completely stopped when we saw this beautiful couple. We absolutely love how the bride chose a blush pink wedding dress. Brides, take note. This is a major trend we are seeing coming down the runways. And big props to her husband for taking a little bit of a risk and adding a pop of color to his wedding day attire too! END
BEGIN HERE Your wedding day is seriously the best day ever. So don't be afraid to kick up your heels and dance down the street with your husband like this bride did! Oh, and another cute added bonus? Their adorable doggie who got to tag along on the big day making this one of the sweetest photos ever. END
BEGIN HERE Yep, it's possible to have a beach wedding in October! Lucky for Catherine and Rob they scored one fine day to get hitched in New York at the Montauk Yacht Club. We completely adore the bride's strapless Vera Wang trumpet wedding dress. It's safe to say this is wedding day perfection.  END
BEGIN HERE Hello to the newlyweds, Mr. and Mrs. Swenson who got married in Mississippi Gardens this weekend. I think we can all agree they had the most amazing fall foliage backdrop for their wedding day photos. We bet they're going to want to frame this one! END
BEGIN HERE This is it... The final countdown to your big day. And along with settling those last few details — figuring out where to seat your eccentric Uncle Carl, firming up the flowers, deciding on your first dance song — you're likely also making one last push to make sure the body that will be wearing that gorgeous white gown looks as good as it possibly can. You and nearly every other woman with an engagement ring on her finger. In fact, research shows that an overwhelming 91 percent of brides-to-be are anxious about their weight. But from here on out, you won't have to be!  END
BEGIN HERE Whether you want to drop those last few pounds or look more toned — or both — we've got a month's worth of daily tips (none of which require starving yourself or working out nonstop!) that will help you feel stunning and confident when you walk down that aisle. You know where to send the thank-you card. Let's get started! END
BEGIN HERE  Beauty & The Beast  END
BEGIN HERE It's a tale as old as time... and one we never get tired of watching! By now, it comes as no surprise that, here at BRIDES, we love love LOVE binge watching truly epic proposal videos. And this one's a beauty! During a stage production of Beauty and the Beast, the actress playing Belle got a fairytale-worthy surprise when her real life sweetheart appeared on stage — and popped the question! END
BEGIN HERE We've seen Disney-themed proposals before and others that took place in the most magical place on Earth — all of them totally picture-perfect starts to countless happily ever afters. There was the one where the groom transformed photos of him and his bride into movie posters of classic Disney films. Another included a mini flash mob in Downtown Disney. Celebs also can't resist the mouse, as MTV's Rob Dyrdek proposed to his girlfriend during a performance of Aladdin at Disneyland. But this Beauty and the Beast proposal opens up a whole new world of adorable! (Not the right movie, we know, but work with us here...) END
BEGIN HERE When the actress playing Belle took the stage for the final song of the performance — big yellow ball gown and all — she was surprised to find her boyfriend standing on stage opposite her, dressed in the Prince's costume. But, hey, the show must go on and without missing a beat, she kept on singing with her love taking over the Prince's lines (and he's not a bad singer to boot!). Although the actress shot him a confused glance or two through the song, the pair continued singing, until the music swelled and this real life Prince took it as his cue to make his about-to-be bride feel like a true princess. END
BEGIN HERE  Attention Princesses: You Can Now Get Married at Disney World With The Park All to Yourself END
BEGIN HERE "Now you know why I was so happy this morning, don't you?" he asked, as this on-stage Belle broke into a huge smile with tears in her eyes. "There's nothing more that I would love than to spend the rest of my life waking up to you everyday," he continued, before dropping to one knee, pulling out the engagement ring. END
BEGIN HERE No surprise here, she of course said yes and after a round of applause from the audience, this Prince and his beauty danced around the stage as the ensemble sang the titular song. END
BEGIN HERE And — duh — they lived happily ever after! END
BEGIN HERE Now more than ever, my clients keep telling me that they're not sure they want to register for wedding gifts. They feel like so many guests are spending money, and taking time, to be there for them on their big day, that it's too much to expect an expensive wedding gift, too. "Your presence is present enough," is a common theme. As a wedding planner, this makes me cringe for two reasons. END
BEGIN HERE   If you are absolutely, positively dead-set against registering for gifts, consider an alternative option for your guests — it will let those who really want to give you a gift invest in something you'd actually like. Whether you register for a honeymoon fund, or sign up for a charitable-giving site that lets your guests donate to the cause of your choice, it's always good to have something to direct guests to when they ask. And trust me, they will ask. END

BEGIN HERE Can you believe it's been five years since the Royal Wedding? We were right there with you at 4 a.m. on April 29, 2011, excited to catch a glimpse of the William and Kate and all the royal celebrations! Kate Middleton's wedding dress, those adorable flower girls, that first kiss... sigh. But, if you can believe it, two babies, and many adorable photo-ops later, the couple is celebrating their fifth wedding anniversary — the traditional gift is wood, in case you were wondering — and we're looking back on the wedding of the century! END
BEGIN HERE   Like any other newlywed couple, William and Kate had earned their much-needed break from the stresses of wedding planning. The new Duke and Duchess headed off to the Seychelles for a romantic honeymoon on the secluded island of Desroches. END
BEGIN HERE Just when we thought we knew everything there was to know about supermodel mom-to-be Chrissy Teigen's pregnancy she dishes even more details. The model and her singer husband John Legend are just a few short months away from welcoming their first child— a baby girl. END
BEGIN HERE Teigen and Legend used in vitro fertilization to help them conceive and they've had a lot more say in their pregnancy than most, including the baby's gender. "I've made this decision," Tiegen told People. "Not only am I having a girl, but I picked the girl from her little embryo. I picked her and was like, 'Let's put in the girl.'" Teigen announced her and Legend were expecting a girl in an Instagram post and we've been dreaming about what her mini-me will be like ever since. END
BEGIN HERE "I think I was most excited and allured by the fact that John would be the best father to a little girl. That excited me," she explained. "It excited me to see... just the thought of seeing him with a little girl. I think he deserves a little girl. I think he deserves that bond. A boy will come along. We'll get there too, so it's not like we really have to pick. But he definitely is very lucky to have a little girl. And this girl is going to be so completely lucky to have John as her papa— it's crazy!" Look's like Teigen's hoping the newest addition to their family will be a total daddy's girl. Seeing the way Legend is a doting dad to the duo's three pups, we have no doubt she will be. END
BEGIN HERE "I'm excited to see what he is going to do because I think we'll have two very different styles," Teigen said. "I'm excited to see that part of John; We've been together so long, and sometimes we look at each other and we're like, 'I know everything about you and you know everything about me,' but we have no idea what we're going to be like as parents." END
BEGIN HERE We can't wait to see what they'll be like as parents either. Although we already have a feeling they'll be the coolest parents ever. After all, they're already the ultimate #RelationshipGoals so we're sure once their little baby is born #ParentingGoals will totally become a thing... END

We've compiled a list of the most common last minute wedding tasks so you can head into your wedding day relaxed, prepared, and ready to become a Mrs.!  END
BEGIN HERE    Maybe they've been tucked away in a sock drawer since you bought them, or maybe you try your ring on every night before bed in anticipation of the day you can actually wear it. Either way, these tiny pieces of jewelry symbolize pretty much everything you're about to embark on and are an essential part of your big day. Choose one person to be in charge of the ring transport, or opt to give them to your officiant so that there is no confusion or concern.  END
BEGIN HERE So you've made plans for a relaxed, casual get-together for your rehearsal dinner and are looking forward to laid-back fun with friends and family before the big day. Now it's time to seek out the right ensemble for the occasion! You'll need the perfect mix of casual and chic, and these Seattle-area stores are precisely where you'll find it.  END
BEGIN HERE Everyone may love having Kocktails with Khloé, but apparently the rest of the Kardashian clan doesn't want to hear her toasts beforehand! On a recent talk show appearance, Khloé Kardashian revealed that sister Kim and brother-in-law Kanye West aren't necessarily fans of her long-winded monologues, as they actually banned her from delivering a speech at their 2014 wedding! END
BEGIN HERE If there's one thing the Kimye wedding was, it was loud. From their rehearsal dinner at Versailles, to flying the entire wedding party to Florence for the actual ceremony, to Kim's Givenchy dress and that epic flower wall, the Kardashian-West union was the wedding heard round the world. But, as it turns out, there was one particular guest that the wedded couple didn't want adding any additional noise. During her recent appearance on James Corden's The Late Late Show, the Kardashian sister dished on why Kimye banned her from speaking at their over-the-top nuptials. END
BEGIN HERE "I'm such a talker and I feel like I'm such an open book," Khloé shared with Corden. Well, she is considered the most tell-it-like-it-is of the Kardashian-Jenner family, after all — which is truly saying something! But apparently, not everyone in her famous family loves that trait. "I did get banned from speaking at Kim and Kanye's wedding," admitted Khloé. "I wasn't allowed to give a speech, because I just ramble," the reality star explained. "I think I'm giving a compliment but maybe I'm not saying the right thing." END
BEGIN HERE  Meet Saint West! Kim Kardashian Just Revealed the First Photo of Her Baby Boy END
BEGIN HERE To add insult to injury, the groom took over as resident rambler at the reception. "Kanye was giving his speech and was like, 'Khloé, I know you want the mic.' He was like taunting me," laughed the Kocktails with Khloé host. "His speech was epic and it went on for like 45 minutes." Oh, the perks of being the groom! END
BEGIN HERE While we can appreciate openness, we admit that may not be the best trait to have when giving a wedding toast. (Who needs someone bringing up your college spring break mistakes in front of your new hubby and his family, right?) But, hey, straight-shooters make for the best dress shopping entourages. Khloé, you're welcome in our fashion closet anytime! END

BEGIN HERE While some venues might provide everything you need for your dream wedding, it's more likely that you'll need to rent at least a few items to pull off your perfect event. Even at venues that provide the basics, you'll often find they're just that: basic. Renting items gives you more flexibility to match items to your color scheme and theme.

BEGIN HERE Drew Pomeranz, pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, wed Carolyn Esserman this past weekend at the breath-taking Four Seasons Resort in Hualalai. The bride wore a gorgeous Galia Lahav lace wedding dress with a very low back while Drew looked mighty sharp in a Tom Ford black tuxedo. Planned by Mindy Weiss, it's safe to say she knocked this wedding out of the park!  END
BEGIN HERE What a beautiful and happy couple! These two said their "I do's" at Villa Verano Estate in Santa Barbara. We can't take our eyes off the bride's lacy wedding dress, with its illusion neckline and sparkly rhinestone belt. So classic and elegant, these photos will be timeless!  END
BEGIN HERE If there's one trend we still can't get enough of in wedding photos, it's smoke bombs! And while the pink smoke grabbed our attention, nothing could distract these two from sharing a passionate kiss on their big day.   END
BEGIN HERE It has been a sweet November so far, especially for Brittany and Niles who were lucky to have this incredible fall day just before it got too cold, and began to snow. And that magic afternoon light? They seriously couldn't have asked for a better day to tie the knot!     END
BEGIN HERE Is this not the cutest getaway car you have ever seen? By the looks of this photo, these two are in for quite a ride together as they begin their new voyage as Mr. and Mrs. END
BEGIN HERE The wedding is over and it's time for you and your hubby to take off on the honeymoon of your dreams. While the destination is definitely worth the trip, sometimes long-haul travel can make you go stir crazy. END

BEGIN HERE Coach Travel Bag END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Courtesy of Coach    END
BEGIN HERE The first item you need to invest in is a good carry-on bag. Look for one that is stylish, but will also hold all the items you may need throughout the flight. And remember it still has to be small enough to fit underneath the seat under you for easy access. ("Explorer" leather travel bag, $695, Coach) END
BEGIN HERE Club Monaco Airport Wrap END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Courtesy of Club Monaco    END
BEGIN HERE Next, be sure to bring a scarf/blanket hybrid. They are the chicest way to stay warm when the plane inevitably cranks the AC. ("Justy" cashmere airport wrap, $319, Club Monaco) END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Courtesy of La Roche-Posay    END
BEGIN HERE A travel sized face mist keeps your skin moisturized and looking dewy throughout the flight. Plus each mist will make you feel more refreshed and vitalized. (Thermal spring water spray, $9.99, La Roche-Posay available at Drugstore.com) END
BEGIN HERE ADAY Socks END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Courtesy of ADAY    END
BEGIN HERE A pair of cashmere socks are a must as they are the easiest way to make you feel cozy and at home on the plane. ("Feet Up" socks, $18, ADAY) END
BEGIN HERE Frends Headphones END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Courtesy of Aboomba    END
BEGIN HERE Invest in a good pair of headphones prior to takeoff. You'll want to block out the plane noise as you enjoy the in-flight movies, and the flimsy earbuds the airlines supply never stay in place. ("Taylor" headphones, $199.95, Frends) END
BEGIN HERE Amazon Kindle Paperweight END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Courtesy of Amazon    END

BEGIN HERE For some brides, picking a pair of wedding shoes is the icing on the cake — a simple-to-shop-for, sparkly accent to complement the real star of the show, your wedding dress! For others, deciding on the fancy footwear can be just as crucial (read: stressful) as saying yes to the dress. But regardless of whether you're indifferent or heel-obsessed (Carrie Bradshaw, eat your heart out), you shouldn't pick a pair of shoes solely on the way they look or how much they cost. There many other factors to keep in mind. We enlisted Maradee Wahl, a Los Angeles-based bridal stylist, to share her advice on what every bride should consider when picking out shoes for the big day. END
BEGIN HERE   If you plan on doing any dancing at all, don't subject your feet to standing in the same pair of stilettos for the entire evening. "I recommend a second pair of shoes for every bride — it will be a great relief to your toes to switch into another style of shoe, even if you switch back again later," says Wahl. But she's not talking sneakers or flats (unless your original pair is of the same height). "Select something that is no more than half an inch different in heel height so it will not affect the hem length of your gown." END
BEGIN HERE You'd expect nothing short of over-the-top for the wedding of E!'s RichKids of Beverly Hills (coming back to E! for a fourth season on April 17) cast member Morgan Stewart, 28. But hold onto your "Boobs and Loubs" (the social-media maven's Instagram handle) — her May 7 SoCal nuptials to real estate mogul and fellow RichKid Brendan Fitzpatrick will be about close friends and family. However, that doesn't mean that this designer duds-loving diva will be without a wedding dress that wows. It's hard to pin down the jet-setting Stewart, but we got the engaged star to stand still long enough to try on a handful of gorgeous gowns and strike a few poses for our April/May 2016 issue (on newsstands now!). And after our day of dress-up, one thing's definitely certain — this is one RichKid who is sure wealthy in style... END
BEGIN HERE "Parts of the wedding will be on the show, but we want to keep it to 150 guests," Morgan told us during our bridal gown excursion. "We invited only people who we really care about." The decor will be minimal and classic (think all-white flowers), but Morgan is planning a banging party where guests can dance and drink until the wee hours. "I want everyone to look around at 2 a.m. and think, 'That was the best night ever, and it flew by!'" END
BEGIN HERE She and Brendan also plan to recite their own vows. It's the moment Morgan's most excited about, since it's "the one time you get to say exactly how you feel about the person you love." And though reality TV is often anything but, how she feels about her fiancé is the real deal. "As life goes on, you have hardships and things happen that you can't control," she says. "But I'm marrying Brendan because he's the one I want to go through all that with, the good and the bad." END
BEGIN HERE "It was so fun playing dress-up!" Morgan said of our frock-filled day, but she's staying tight-lipped about her own search and will say only that she's leaning toward a custom-made creation. But needless to say, she's got plenty of wedding dress inspo from these ultra-chic dresses. END
BEGIN HERE Morgan Stewart in Monique Lhuillier END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Andrew Macpherson; Illusion V-neck gown with layered horsehair skirt by Monique Lhuillier ($7,990); Earrings, CZ by Kenneth Jay Lane; Flowers by Moon Canyon    END
BEGIN HERE "This gown is comfortable and stunning but very low-cut in the front," the reality star said of this Monique Lhuillier number. One downfall of the look? "When we 'borrowed' a Great Dane and he dragged me along the street, I was sure that I would fall out of the top!" Oops! Wouldn't want that at her ceremony. END
BEGIN HERE Britany LaManna Wedding from Britany LaManna Wedding on Vimeo. END
BEGIN HERE Can you say #MaidofHonorGoals? Just a couple weeks ago, Taylor Swift made her way down the aisle for some hometown "I dos." Before you get too excited, no, she wasn't tying the knot with Calvin Harris (but we can dream, can't we?). She was standing by her best friend's side as she got hitched to her childhood sweetheart. Swift's maid-of-honor dress at her BFF Britany Maack's wedding has been making the rounds on the 'net (And for good reason! Seriously, have you seen that thing?), but it's her too-sweet MOH speech that's got us reaching for the Kleenex. END
BEGIN HERE In the newly-released wedding video of the hometown nuptials, Swift's longtime bestie Britany wed Benjamin LaManna in Reading, Pennsylvania. And although all eyes are on the bride throughout the 11-minute video, we can't help but notice her award-winning maid of honor. END
BEGIN HERE From the dimly-lit rehearsal dinner to the reception dance floor, the "Love Story" singer can be seen helping the bride's own love story come true. Maid of honors, feel free to take notes! This is how you get the job done... END
BEGIN HERE Swift of course helped her friend get glam, made sure her gorgeous Reem Acra gown was without a flaw, and stood beside her for her "I dos" (you know, just typical MOH duties...), and then completely shut it down with an out-of-this-world maid-of-honor speech. Starting off by reminiscing on the couple's adorable beginnings, Swift had us hooked from the moment she grabbed the mic. "He would chase her and pursue her through middle school and junior high and high school, and their paths would diverge, and then come back together," she said at the reception. "It would be so magically unpredictable, but at the same time, so incredibly fated just like the best love stories are." Wait a minute, are these lyrics to a Taylor Swift love song, because their story sounds like an absolute fairytale! END
BEGIN HERE    "My favorite accomplishment of my entire life is that everything in my life has changed except for me and Britany," Swift continued. "She was my partner in crime at Brownie's sleepaway camp and she was my date to the Grammys. And little did either of us know that prince charming for Britany would be the kid that sat next to me in class with a bowl cut and a Lego lunchbox." Are you paying attention, MOHs of the world? Y'all got some competition! END
BEGIN HERE Her maid-of-honor speech wasn't the only thing Swift slayed. The superstar songstress also broke it down on the reception dance floor with some killer moves and of course took the stage to serenade the newlyweds with her Grammy-winning pipes. Pulling double duty as maid of honor and wedding singer? Swift just won all the BFF awards! END

BEGIN HERE "The wedding was amazing. But while I had an amazing photographer, I didn't hire a professional videographer. So many wonderful moments were captured frozen in time, but there are no moving images." —Sheila END
BEGIN HERE "What I regret is spending so much time worrying about little details — the seating plan, the music, the bridesmaids' dresses... In the end, all the stress I put myself through leading up to the big day was avoidable. Your wedding is perfect regardless of whether certain details don't work out the way you planned." —Ruth END
BEGIN HERE "Ok, I admit it — while my bridesmaids and I were getting our hair and makeup done we demolished a pitcher of margaritas. The drinking continued through the photos and at the reception. So while I enjoyed the wedding, I don't remember as much of it as I would have if I hadn't been several sheets to the wind." —Amy END
BEGIN HERE "In retrospect, I wish my bridegroom and I had toasted our parents. They put so much into the wedding, not to mention all the years of raising us, they certainly deserved a special shout-out." —Dana  END
BEGIN HERE "Instead of leaving for our honeymoon the morning after the wedding — which ended at three in the morning! — we would have waited a day to take off for Costa Rica. The whole first day of the trip I was exhausted and hung over." —Tina  END
BEGIN HERE "We felt compelled to invite a lot of people to the wedding we weren't really close to. If I could do the wedding over, there would only be people celebrating with us who were truly part of the journey for my husband and me." —Kim END

BEGIN HERE "My husband and I chose a destination wedding in Jamaica. It was raining the morning of our wedding. I was so upset about the potential of having to be married under a pavilion at the resort, that I let it upset me for hours. Now that I look back on it, my perspective should have been that I was marrying the love of my life that day, and that the weather isn't really what matters. As it turned out, the sky cleared up, and we had a beautiful wedding ceremony on the beach after all. I could have spared myself the memory of being crabby and upset the morning of my wedding, if I'd have just gone with the flow." —Jessica END
BEGIN HERE "My biggest wedding day regret was not trying on the veil before my wedding day. I hated it!

The talented reality show star-turned-future bride, couldn't help but gush over her new fiancé, Robert Herjavec, and talk all things wedding planning at the Oscars 2016 parties! END
BEGIN HERE From Chrissy Teigen and John Legend, to Lady Gaga and Taylor Kinney, this year's Oscar red carpet was jam-packed with some of Hollywood's most swoon-worthy couples! No exception to the gorgeous celebrity twosome's were reality TV's latest love story, who wasted no time in taking awards season by storm. The stunning Dancing With the Stars expert, and her Shark Tank judge beau, showed off their beaming smiles, and newly engaged bling, while posing on Sunday's red carpet for Elton John's AIDS Foundation Oscars 2016 party, Us Weekly reports. END
BEGIN HERE The dancing bride-to-be blissfully showed off her stunning engagement ring, while her fiancé spilled all of the details on his recent romantic proposal. "We went to the house and I had rose petals going up to the pool," said Herjavec, who met his forever love before filming season 20 of the hit dancing show back in March. "In the pool was a big swan and on the swan was a box. She pulled the swan in, opened the box, and I said, 'Actually that's not for you. That's for me." The Shark Tank judge continued by elaborating on his bended knee moment by saying, "I opened the box and the ring was inside. And I said, 'Will you marry me?' and she started crying and doing crazy sounds," laughed the TV star. "And then I asked again and she started crying and doing crazy songs. And I asked a third time and I was like, 'OK this is really uncomfortable!" Good thing this story has a happy ending! END
BEGIN HERE But this groom-to-be wasn't the only one gushing about the fairytale proposal! Johnson couldn't help but radiate when talking about the milestone moment by saying, "I'm so happy," adding, "It was pretty amazing." END

BEGIN HERE When it comes to wedding planning, it looks like this talented pair already has a few tricks up their sleeve! The blissful couple gushed about their first dance, and couldn't help but hide their excitement for their future wedding song. "When we were on the show last year, the week before we got kicked off, they gave us a song. And it was Etta James' 'At Last,'" said Johnson's other half. "It was our next dance to do but we got voted out so we never got to do it," added the Dancing With the Stars alum. The doting groom-to-be quickly added, "so it will be our first dance as husband and wife I guess." END
BEGIN HERE Even though the wedding planning discussions are still a bit early for the dancing duo, the future Mrs. Herjavec was confident that their big wedding-bash will be hosted in America despite Johnson's family living in Australia. "We'll bring everyone here," said the blonde beauty, "We might go back to Australia and do a big party there with all my friends and that one will probably be pretty wild, you know Aussies get crazy." The Australian bride-to-be couldn't help but discuss her joyous present situation by adding, "[But] now I get to have fun and start planning a wedding. It's great!" END
BEGIN HERE When it comes celebrity dream BFFs, the hilarious Amy Schumer always manages to top our list. And this weekend, the actress' good pal just basically lived out our fantasy when she scored Schumer as a bridesmaid at her wedding! Schumer took on bridesmaid duties like an old pro, donning the dress, the 'do, and even brought along a handsome plus-one. And best of all, we're betting that there were no pre-wedding jitters for this bride. How could there be with the hilarious comedian at her side? END
BEGIN HERE Schumer may be busy filming her latest movie with Goldie Hawn in Hawaii, but this weekend was all about the bride! Schumer attended the wedding of her newlywed friends, Tara Alana and Rusty Fitton, snagging the gig of bridesmaid at the nuptials. For the big day, the comedian complemented the bride's strapless mermaid wedding dress in a strapless bridesmaid dress in the super trendy soft blush hue. Schumer's blonde locks were also giving us major wedding hair goals, as it was swept up and away from her face in a bohemian-chic braided up-do. END
BEGIN HERE In case you wanted an inspiration photo to print out for your stylist, Schumer has got you covered. (Thanks, girl!) The Trainwreck actress posted a pic (see below) on Instagram of the wedding festivities with the bride, groom, and her plus-one, boyfriend Ben Hanisch. END
BEGIN HERE "Congratulations to @tara_alana and @rustolleum in the best wedding ever," Schumer captioned the black-and-white snapshot. "Very proud to be a bmaid." She also got in on the photobooth fun, snapping a few pics with friends and tons of too-funny props at the reception. Schumer was never one to pass up a hilarious photo op, after all. (Anyone remember when she threw herself down on the red carpet in front of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West?) END

BEGIN HERE Mom always knows best, even when it comes to your marriage. These five brides learned extremely important lessons from their mamas, and are here to share their mother's most valuable pearls of wisdom. END
BEGIN HERE "My mom taught me that when you fall in love and he is 'The One' you will know, and she advised me to wait until I had zero doubts. She didn't settle, and she didn't want me to settle either. I was always very picky and had doubts, so I had almost given up on finding love or marriage. But when I met my husband, just like my mom told me, I knew, and I finally understood what she had meant." — Margo  END
BEGIN HERE "My mother taught me that marriage is not about being right all the time. It's about being the bigger person, even when the other person is wrong. That means you let go of the attitude and the angry stare, even though your partner might deserve it." — Chantay END
BEGIN HERE "My mother always says, 'never embarrass your spouse in front of other people.' She gives great advice, and my friends often tease me because I quote my mom a lot. But this pearl of wisdom in particular has always stuck with me. Your spouse should always feel like you are his or her No. 1 supporter and that you're on the same team. If you embarrass them in front of others, intentionally or not, it can start to feel like you aren't on his or her side. So I always try to keep this in mind." — Rachel END
BEGIN HERE "Every evening, whenever my mother expected my father to return home, she would go comb her hair and put on lipstick and perfume. I know, I know — that sounds incredibly outdated and sexist and all. But the kernel of truth behind those gestures is to present the best you instead of the dregs that are left over at the end of the day. In my own marriage, I try to remember to make a priority of staying connected and even delighted with each other. Simple concepts, hard to apply: Actually making eye contact, actively listening instead of multitasking, carving out alone time without the noise of everyday life." — Bernice  END
BEGIN HERE "My mom always told me, 'choose your battles.' In fact, she still says this to me to this day. In a marriage, there are lots of little things that turn into big things, and this little mantra helps me decide which issues are important enough to me to bring up with my spouse, and which things I can let go." — Hilary END

BEGIN HERE Two Harts have become one! Comedian Kevin Hart has just tied the knot with his sweetheart, Eniko Parrish, in a lavish wedding ceremony this weekend. And while we're used to having Hart bring tears to our eyes with side-splitting laughter, we're just plain crying over the couple's gorgeous wedding photos, as well as their brand new, over-the-top wedding rings. END
BEGIN HERE After a two-year engagement, Hart and Parrish wed in a Santa Barbara, California ceremony on Saturday evening. "I honestly can say that I'm lucky enough to have an amazing woman," Hart told Us Weekly ahead of the big day. "I'm looking forward to getting married. We got seven years under our belt, been engaged for two. It's time." And the time finally arrived! END
BEGIN HERE For her walk down the aisle, Parrish donned a custom Vera Wang mermaid wedding dress, featuring a tulle skirt, sheer bodice, and French Chantilly lace appliqués, according to People magazine, while Hart kept things classic in a traditional black tux. And the nupitals were a true family affair with the best man role being filled by Hart's eight-year-old son Hendrix, whom he shares with his ex-wife Torrei Hart. His daughter Heaven was also of course in attendance, matching the bride in a white cocktail dress accessorized with a flower crown. END
BEGIN HERE The couple exchanged blinged-out wedding bands — to go with the bride's show-stopping engagement ring, we assume. Hart shared an image of their new rings, which includes a super sparkly men's band for Hart, with the caption "#DopePic." Indeed! END
BEGIN HERE Just as breathtaking as the bride's wedding gown was the Harts' heart-stopping wedding venue. The couple took their big day portraits in a stunning white gazebo draped in greenery, while the reception locale featured wooden tables and chairs adorned with white blooms, and crystal chandeliers hanging overhead. Parrish also pulled off a quick costume change post-"I do's," exchanging her mermaid frock for another Vera Wang gown with long lace sleeves and an open back. Oh, and the after-party included an honest to goodness ferris wheel and a merry-go-round according to a Snapchat video posted by the bride. Was this a wedding or a carnival? Either way, why weren't we invited?! END

BEGIN HERE If Anna Camp and Skylar Astin have anything to say about it, joint bachelor-bachelorette parties are ALL the rage. The Pitch Perfect stars celebrated their upcoming nuptials with joint festivities this weekend in California, and we have the fantastic photos to prove it. END
BEGIN HERE   The bride- and groom-to-be started the day with separate celebrations with their besties — a bridal shower brunch for Camp and a pool party for Astin, according to E! News. The photo evidence below proves that it was a grand ol' time — complete with pool floats for the boys and silly selfies for the ladies. In one such photo with his friends, 28-year-old Astin captioned it "KILLIN IT at the Bachelor Party!" and with all of his best guys jokingly laying face down in the pool. (Strange but punny guy you are there, Skylar.) In another photo of his entire crew, he wrote, "This is the face of a guy who's about to rendezvous with his wife to be!!" while he grinned away. Cue the 'awwwws." END
BEGIN HERE As for the soon-to-be Mrs., Camp, 33, appeared to be enjoying herself just as much. She posed for a selfie with a crown atop her head and her BFFs all in the photo behind her (we see you, Brittany Snow!). The ladies-in-waiting treated the bride to a bridal shower luncheon to kick off the day, and then the rowdiness began (as evidenced by Snow's sassy note to the bride about getting her drink on, below). END
BEGIN HERE After separate fêtes to begin the extravaganza, the two joined forces to have the ultimate bachelor-bachelorette party activity: line dancing! Outfitted in a short white dress and cowgirl hats (complete with a veil, obviously), the former True Blood actress piled into a limo with her best girls to meet her groom and his men for some country line dancing. This all went down at the Cowboy Palace Saloon in Chatsworth, California. END
BEGIN HERE The happy (or should we say aca-awesome) couple announced their engagement at the beginning of 2016 after a NYE proposal — in which they both shared matching Instagram posts announcing the happy news. The two have been dating for over three years after meeting on the set of Pitch Perfect and seem to be super in love (let alone absolutely adorable). This is the first marriage for Astin and second for Camp, who filed for divorce from actor Michael Mosley in 2013. END
BEGIN HERE It's safe to say that their weekend of fun was quite a hit — and exhausting, as an pre-wedding parties are, of course. "And that's a wrap on the greatest weekend ever celebrating true love and happiness!" Camp shared on social media after the festivities. "Thank you to all the wonderful friends that helped put a smile on my face. I love you all so much. Now... Sleep." If the bride and groom already had this much fun on their pre-wedding soirées, we can only imagine how lively their big day will be. See the photos of the fun, below! END
BEGIN HERE As soon as you've said "I do" and walked back up the aisle, the wedding diet is officially over. You've heard it before, a lot of brides only eat a few hors d'oeuvres and cake at their wedding, and we think cake for dinner is the perfect way to celebrate! And then, of course, there is the morning-after brunch. What better way to nurse a hangover or aching feet than eggs, bacon, Bloody Marys or mimosas and a huge cup of coffee? And while you spent the morning of your wedding day primping, we say the morning-after is the perfect opportunity to sleep in, take a quick shower, and slip on something super comfortable. For the bride who wants to milk wearing white for all it's worth — without sacrificing feeling like she's still in pajamas! — we've rounded up a few outfits perfect for your wedding weekend brunch. We won't blame you if you're still wearing them when you crawl back into bed for a nap! END

BEGIN HERE Instagram evidence of Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth's blossoming relationship (and rumored engagement) just keeps getting better and better (and more frequent, t-goodness!). This past weekend was no exception, either. In a series of rather, erm, strange Instagram posts added by attendees of a gold-themed birthday bash, it's evident that The Last Song actors are spending TONS of quality time together, even if that "quality time" just so happens to mean painting each other butts. That's something we simply can't make up. END
BEGIN HERE Now, while our American athletes like Michael Phelps and Simone Biles were killing it in the gold medal department at the Olympics in Rio this past week, these crazy goons were celebrating an all-gold party of their own for none other than Luke Hemsworth's wife, Samantha. We're not sure who was in charge of the bizarre celebration, but we have a feeling our "Can't Stop" miss Miley maaaay have had something to do with it. END
BEGIN HERE The guest list sported rock legend Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips, along with pro surfer Kelly Slater. Guests were urged to wear all-gold outfits, and were even able to express their creativity by painting pictures using their butts. Don't knock it 'till you try it, we guess? But quite possibly the most eye-opening takeaway from this Cyrus-approved party was seeing a new couple name emerge. Say buh-bye Milliam and hellooo to Liley because according to a very revealing Insta, that's what the celeb duo is going by these days. WHY DIDN'T WE THINK OF THIS?! END
BEGIN HERE Since reconciling their differences earlier this year, LILEY (it almost hurts to say) has been spotted in Australia grabbing lunch with Hemsworth's parents, singing J-Biebs in the car with a too-cute beagle, and just generally being adorable together via Instagram and in paparazzi shots. Cyrus has been spotted much of this year wearing the engagement ring Hemsworth gifted her back in 2012 before the A-lister duo ended their relationship — and consequently our hearts, TBH. But, as this gorgeous couple proves, all good things do not have to come to an end. Here's to Liley forever! And many more painted butts, obviously. END

BEGIN HERE After all the planning, your whirlwind wedding day, and that morning-after brunch that feels way earlier than 10am, heading off on your honeymoon is a welcome break from the madness, whether you're up for a big adventure or can't wait to lounge on the beach. It's even better because of the extra perks you get when you're a newlywed! But asking for special treatment can feel a little weird, so we've put together a few tips for letting people know you're honeymooning, without the awkward interaction. END
BEGIN HERE When you are booking your honeymoon travel arrangements, do as much as you can on the phone or via email, instead of on travel websites. Often representatives and concierges will ask what you're traveling for, which is the perfect opportunity to casually mention that you'll be celebrating your marriage. From the airline to your hotel, they'll be able to make a little note, which will pop up when you check in and get passed on to other staff-members so there is champagne and strawberries waiting in your room upon arrival. END
BEGIN HERE Making honeymoon dinner reservations? Follow the same pattern. When the maitre d' asks how many guests will be joining you, revel in the chance to say "It will be me and my fiancé — I mean, he'll be my husband by then!" or respond that you'll be newlyweds if they ask if you're celebrating a special occasion. END
BEGIN HERE It might feel awkward, but just remember: It saves you the trouble of explaining you're newlyweds halfway through dinner! It also makes acknowledging your special occasion easier for the hotel or restaurant, as they can prepare any celebratory perks in advance instead of hurrying to pull something together at the last minute. So relax, enjoy your wedding, and look forward to that welcome glass of champagne as a honeymooner! END

Michael Phelps' number one fans, Nicole Johnson and their baby son Boomer — a.k.a. the cutest cheering section in all of Rio de Janeiro. While we swooned over the sheer adorableness of the Olympian's fiancé and little one rooting him on as Phelps won his 19th, 20th, 21st, 22nd, and 23rd gold medals (seriously, is this guy even human?), cheerleading for her soon-to-be hubby isn't Nicole Johnson's only gig.

BEGIN HERE   It took the Olympian and beauty queen awhile to get where they are today. The pair had originally started dating in 2007 before ending their relationship four years later. "I'm pretty sure we both shared stuff with our parents and were like, 'Oh, this is it, there's no way we are getting back together,'" Johnson recently shared with Access Hollywood. "And then when we finally did, it was still a little rocky and figuring things out, figuring each other out because it had been some time. But we didn't miss a beat." END

We imagine that Kevin, who was suited up in a black tuxedo, is naturally being his funny self here, making sure his wedding day was filled with tons of laughter. END

BEGIN HERE It was pouring rain the evening Bobby Bott planned to pop the question to Kelly McCready, his high school sweetheart. But rather than select a sunnier night, the anxious groom-to-be simply worked the stormy weather into his proposal. "He strategically placed notes around the house that eventually led to a gift: A pair of Hunter rain boots," says Kelly, adding that the weather-proof shoes came with yet another note that explained a hired car was waiting to whisk her away. The car dropped Kelly at Orange County's Crystal Cove State Park, where she walked a long and winding boardwalk straight to Bobby. There, he got down on bended knee and asked her to be his wife. "I was so happy that I said 'of course' instead of 'yes,'" Kelly laughs, "so that has always been a joke with us." END
BEGIN HERE For their August 8, 2015, wedding, the California residents wanted to bring a little bit of their shared home to their native Ohio. They chose Gervasi Vineyard as the backdrop for their outdoor affair and played off the vineyard's natural beauty with a neutral-palette. "When the scenery is so great you don't have to add a lot of other elements to make your day beautiful," the bride says. And she's right!

BEGIN HERE Rather than wear a veil, Kelly asked her florist, Fair Rarity Flowers, to craft a hair piece made from greens. "I hadn't expected to love it so much," Kelly admits, "and I ended up completely changing my hair from what we decided on in the trail appointments so that I could highlight the hair piece." A gold necklace that dipped in the back was her final touch. END

"I loved how they ended up choosing a mixture of beaded materials and other fabrics, different necklines, and in a variety of shades," she says. As pretty as the final result looked, the mismatched selection of gowns was also a budget-friendly choice. Since her bridesmaids were able to shop within their own budgets, dresses ranged in price from just $60 to $350. END
BEGIN HERE Unlike many brides, Kelly requested that Fair Rarity Flowers not use a single rose in any of the bouquets. Instead, the florist designed organic arrangements made from a mixture of greens, anemones, and ranunculus. END
BEGIN HERE Bobby and his groomsmen dressed in blue suits. "But we were careful not to get a midnight blue suit." Kelly says. "We felt that really dark color would be too formal for the venue and may be hot in the sun." Their suits were paired with caramel-colored leather shoes, white collared shirts, and slim grey ties, plus delicate boutonnieres made from springs of lavender and rosemary, all wrapped in twine. END

Once there, everyone picked up cones of petals and greens to toss when the couple recessed down the aisle. To help keep their guests comfortable during the summer nuptials, the bride and groom set up a cold drink station at the entrance. END
BEGIN HERE Two flower girls toddled down the aisle in cream-colored combination crocheted and tulle dresses. "The girls ultimately chose the dresses," Kelly says. "They really wanted to look like princesses, so tulle was necessary." Rather than toss petals as they walked, the girls carried peach balloons filled with confetti. "They had a blast carrying the huge balloons down the aisle." END
BEGIN HERE The couple's ring bearers also had a fun trip down the aisle, making their entrance in a vintage wagon. "We had our eldest nephew pull our 10-month-old nephew," Kelly says. "We thought he might wiggle out, but he stayed put and loved the attention." END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Amy Galon Photography    END
BEGIN HERE The bride and groom's florist decorated the white-washed doorway that served as their ceremony altar with a thick greenery garland. "That was the extent of the décor," says Kelly. "It was super simple, but that helped the focus stay on our bridal party and on us!" END
BEGIN HERE A friend served as the couple's officiant, which gave Kelly and Bobby the opportunity to customize the ceremony. They kept it short and sweet, writing their own vows and selecting a few readings. "It was really personal and felt right." END
BEGIN HERE But when it came time to recite those vows, the bride admits she got nervous. "It was really special, but also nerve-wrecking to say such heartfelt things to each other in front of a crowd. I really loved hearing his vows, but reciting my own vows was tough. In the end, I am glad we did it, but was happy when I could go back to repeating after the officiant." END

With it's stone and wood accents, the couple again felt they needed little to make their reception space pop. They asked their florist to create long green garlands for their banquet-style tables. A friend painted green wine bottles with the couple's table numbers. "We sat in a cream settee, draped with a green garland and ribbon," says Kelly. "Making our seat a bit different than everyone else's felt special and made for some great photos." END
BEGIN HERE The menu was one of the easiest things for the couple to plan. They chose the house specialty — beef short ribs with mushroom Chianti sauce — and added a salad and family-style dessert. "We were all sitting at long tables, so it felt really interactive and intimate." END

And she would advise other brides to go with their own instincts when it comes to the big day. "Pick out the things you've liked and disliked from weddings you've been to in the past, and try to incorporate those into your day," she says. "Don't be afraid to go against tradition and nix something where you see fit! At the end of the day, you want the wedding to reflect your style and personality as a couple. After all, it is a celebration of you two." END

BEGIN HERE As brides, we pretty much go to any length to ensure our wedding is absolute Disney-approved perfection. We spend months planning every single wedding detail down to the tee, just so that we can look back on this very special day and think, "Yep, my wedding killed it." But as you have probably heard by now (either from your mom, aunt, or friends), not everything goes off without a hitch on your big day. From wedding cake disasters to ring mixups to severe weather alerts destroying any hopes of saying your "I do's" outside, mishaps out of your control are bound to happen. Which brings us to one particularly amused bride who didn't let the, um, imperfections ruin her wedding day. END
BEGIN HERE In a rather hilarious image posted on Reddit, a bride, who is fully dressed in her white, cap-sleeved gown in front of what appears to be a hotel elevator, is seen smiling next to a couple of odd looking characters. The woman on the left is dressed head-to-toe in skintight latex, showing only her eyes, mouth, and bun of hair on top of her head. On a side note, how is she not sweltering in that thing?! The other person standing to the right of the cheezing bride appears to be wearing a mask of sorts, along with a chain around his neck and some kind of ear appendages on his head. Can you guess what convention these two belong to? A fetish ball, that's what. END
BEGIN HERE And how exactly did these complete opposites of the spectrum wind up in the same hotel lobby, you ask? Well, according to Reddit, "Sometimes the hotel holding your wedding also has a fetish ball booked." Awkward. Despite this minor hiccup on her wedding day though, this bride seems to have taken it in stride. Laughter is the best medicine, after all! END

But sometimes things get lodged inside the vaginal canal and are so hard to retrieve, it seems like you'll need the gynecological version of the jaws of life to make things right. It's like your vagina's taunting you, saying, "You want this thing out? You'll have to pry it from my warm, wet walls lol good luck." Fortunately, if you do lose control of a tampon or wayward condom, there are a few actions you can take to make it easier to remove.

BEGIN HERE "As a frequent traveler, I had built up rewards under my maiden name — not a ton, but every little bit helps — and it wasn't as easy as logging into the airline's user settings and changing my name like I thought it would be. Some of the airlines required mailing in a copy of my marriage certificate, which I didn't have enough certified copies of because I had to use them for things such as getting a new driver's license and social security card. I ended up having to sign up for new accounts under my new last name and let some points and rewards go." — Kristen END
BEGIN HERE "I didn't want to lose my last name, but I also didn't want two last names or a hyphenated last name. Instead, I wanted to add a middle name. But rather than do that, the social security employee gave me two last names. I didn't discover there was a problem until I went to pay my taxes five months later and I didn't exist. After than debacle, I didn't try to change my name again until our four-year anniversary." — Jane END
BEGIN HERE "I had a store credit card, and when I changed my name on it, they refused me credit until I placed my husband's name on it instead. It was as if I had never existed until I got married. I should have let it alone, but I ended up closing the card because I was furious." — Carol END
BEGIN HERE "I hyphenated my last name when we married and it is amazing how many websites do not let you hyphenate. You learn over time that airlines prefer that you just run the two names together, but others only work when you leave a space with no hyphen. It is so annoying when you try to type it correctly with the hyphen and it gives you an error message. I guess you just get used to it after a while." — Paige END
BEGIN HERE "My issue with changing my name was how long all my new credit and debit cards, checks, and things like that took to come in. You have to carry both your old ID and new ID to prove that the credit cards are yours when purchasing something and then show both at the bank. I also found it difficult to change online accounts like PayPal, because they require forms to be submitted to prove name changes." — June END
BEGIN HERE "Shortly after I changed my name, I lost my new social security card. When I got a new job the following year, I went to the social security office to get another copy. However, they couldn't give it to me because my new driver's license had the wrong birthday on it. I hadn't even noticed. So I had to go through the whole process again because of the DMV's mistake. It was terrible." — Lainey END

BEGIN HERE Billingsley, 25, winner of Miss Arkansas in 2013, received the surprise of her life on August 9 when her boyfriend, who is part of the duo Dan + Shay, got down on one knee and asked her to marry him, according to People. "I liked it ... so I put a ring on it," Mooney, 24, shared on Instagram with the cutest photo of the couple embracing and beaming from ear to ear. "I'm the luckiest man in the world. Hannah, I love you." END
BEGIN HERE The duo was enjoying some quality time when the "From the Ground Up" singer proposed outside of a church — a bit of foreshadowing to their big day if we do say so ourselves... Time to head to the chapel (or at least get to wedding planning)! After the proposal, both of their families were close by inside the church, ready to surprise the new bride-to-be. Major props to the groom for the flawless execution of the big question and family celebrations. END
BEGIN HERE Of course, the stunned ex-beauty queen shared some proposal tidbits on social media once she stopped crying, posting a snap of the two of them walking towards the church where the proposal went down. In the photo, she wore a high ponytail and burgundy dress, rocking grey suede thigh-high boots while her hubby-to-be rocked a black suit. On the IG post she wrote, "I just wanted to thank everyone wholeheartedly for the well wishes and congratulations... It's been a special week made even more precious by the love of so many! Thank you thank you thank you!" END
BEGIN HERE While many brides-to-be know that the proposal is coming in some shape or form, Billingsley seemed like she was truly surprised, tears and all. Mooney noted about the proposal, "I had so much I wanted to say to this beautiful girl when I was proposing, but I was so shaky and nervous I don't even remember what I said, or if what I said made a lick of sense," Mooney explained to the magazine. "Hannah cried. As you can see in the picture, she cried a lot!" END
BEGIN HERE The couple started dating in 2014, and Mooney shared with People that he was sure that Billingsley was "The One" right from the start. "From the very first time I saw her, I knew I wanted to marry her." (Isn't this was every girl wants to hear? Swoooon.) He admits that it took a bit of prodding to get her on the hook in the beginning. "She's stunning. I finally convinced her to come to a show in Fayetteville, Arkansas." And from then on, sparks were flying — and the rest is history. END
BEGIN HERE "She's the best thing that's ever happened to me, so I had to lock it down. She's my better, and much better-looking half," he said slyly. With a doting husband-to-be like that, it's hard not to think that Billingsley is a pretty lucky gal (especially since she most likely gets nightly serenades from her crooner fiancé). Congrats, lovebirds — have fun with the planning! See the adorable proposal photos, below. END

BEGIN HERE Wedding toasts: Whether you love them or you hate them, they're pretty much inevitable. Planning who is speaking at your wedding is a great way to control what you'll get, but some more talkative guests can be persistent mic hounds. So how can you keep those unwanted toasts to a minimum? Here are a few tips from our experts. END
BEGIN HERE Whether you've gotten requests from additional guests who may want to make a toast, know the rest of your bridesmaids want to grab the mic, or have an uncle who gets chatty when he's had a couple glasses of wine, figuring out how to prevent people from adding to the list of scheduled toasts at your wedding can be a challenge. END
BEGIN HERE One option is to set aside a separate time for people to speak, most likely at your rehearsal dinner. Open up the mic or, if the thought of an hour and a half of toasts gives you hives, create a list of who will be speaking to keep things under control. Make sure everyone knows who is toasting at the rehearsal dinner versus at the wedding so they can be prepared in advance. Happy to have a free-for-all? After the traditional speeches have been made (by the hosts, as well as the couple, followed by anyone you might have specifically asked to speak the night before the wedding), let guests know that if anyone else would like to make a toast, the microphone will be open for the rest of the evening. Just make sure you've got someone stationed nearby with a video camera to capture the fun! END
BEGIN HERE Worried someone will snag the microphone during the band's break? Let your band or DJ, as well as your wedding planner and other venue staff, know that unsolicited speeches are a no-go so they can keep an eye on the mic (or even turn it off until they're ready to play again). They can help intercept anyone who might want to make a toast, so you don't have to worry at all. END

On November 11, Bailon and Houghton said "I do" at Paris' ultra-luxe Hotel Plaza Athénéel in front of about 70 wedding guests including Bailon's The Real co-hosts Loni Love, Jeannie Mai, and Tamera Mowry. And although you might not have gotten a spot on that coveted guest list or sat next to Loni Love during the ceremony, this clip reveals the moment that Houghton and Bailon officially became Mr. and Mrs. END

"With this ring, I thee wed," the bride told her now-hubby as she slipped a gold wedding band on his finger. Soft, instrumental music played in the background as the couple stood before their family and friends. And then it was time for the big moment — their first wedded kiss!

Although their courtship was long, the couple wasted no time in beginning to plan their September 19, 2015, wedding — especially since the bride-to-be already knew where she wanted to say "I do." "My family has been going to Nantucket since I was born and many of my most cherished moments have taken place on the island," Meghan says.

BEGIN HERE "Rather than buying an espresso machine that you might realistically use twice, why not have your money grow so you can achieve your dreams together?" asks Elle Kaplan, finance expert and founder of LexION Capital. "Everything from buying a house to supporting your children financially can be achieved through smart investing, and it all starts with putting a few dollars towards your future together." END
BEGIN HERE Here are four ideas to get you started with that wedding gift money. END
BEGIN HERE   Sometimes simply saving your money is the best move you can make. Why? "An emergency fund is the way to sleep easy every night and avoid debt when an unexpected expense occurs," says Kaplan. "Everything from a broken faucet to car repairs can become far more costly if you need to finance them with credit card debt — and that's why you should save six to eight months of living expenses."

"Checking in with you about whether you want something to eat too, need a glass of water when they head to the kitchen, getting a plate down for you, whatever it may be, is a sign of awareness and generosity," says Doares. "Only thinking about themselves in these circumstances is self-centered and does not bode well for the long-term health of your relationship." END

Or when four spurned high school girls united to ruin his life in John Tucker Must Die? Yikes...), Jesse Metcalfe has officially found the love of his life — and proposed to her! Yes, Metcalfe is engaged after popping the question to his longtime sweetheart, Cara Santana. And John Tucker made us want to die when we got a look at the engagement ring he picked out for his soon-to-be bride. Seriously, it's that pretty! END
BEGIN HERE So just who is this Cara Santana? If you can only recall Metcalfe canoodling on-screen with Eva Longoria, you're not alone. Metcalfe and Santana — who earns a living as a trendy fashion blogger — have managed to keep their love pretty much out of the spotlight, but they've actually been in a relationship for over a decade. "I wouldn't say it was love at first sight," the actor shared with YourTango back in 2013. "It was more of a slow burn, which I think is a better start for a relationship. I think if it comes on fast and furious, it generally fizzles out just as fast. We were slow and steady." We'd say! "We took the time to get to know each other," added the bride-to-be. "We've known each other for, like, 10 years." It may have taken a decade, but these two are finally heading down the aisle — and that ring was definitely worth the wait! END
BEGIN HERE According to Us Weekly, Metcalfe did the deed aboard a 50-foot sailboat as they floated along the Hudson River in New York City. Cue the sunset and Eric Clapton's "Pretty Girl" playing in the background. (Yes, really!) Oh, and a five and half carat diamond engagement ring, of course! This sparkler is a serious stunner.

"We met at a karaoke bar in Burbank, California, in August of 2011. It was very romantic, I assure you!" says Tara. With two young boys, Oliver and Leo, the couple skipped a formal engagement and instead decided it was time. "We always knew we would get married," Tara explains. "We designed my ring together and picked out my wedding band." And that was it! The pair sought out a property where they could have a simple, rustic celebration that honored the Christmas season, and found the Graf Barn in Oxnard, California. The barn and surrounding property, filled to the brim with one-of-a-kind antiques, is just an hour outside of Los Angeles. "The experience was so laid-back," says Tara. "The owner, Laina, does almost everything herself. She's a one stop shop, it's incredible!" END
BEGIN HERE For their December 12, 2015, wedding, Tara and Kyle — who played Beaver in the hit TV show Veronica Mars — opted for dark red, green, and blue hues, accented with silver, gold, and twinkling lights. "We both love Christmas, and wanted everything to be simple and cozy. It felt like being in a cabin, so I think we achieved what we were after!" says the bride.

Phelps' mom, Debbie Phelps weighed in, sharing that she always felt that Johnson was "The One." In fact, when they got back together and the swimmer told his mom that he was back with his leading lady, his mom was thrilled. "That's where he should be," she said. END

Runaway Bride wasn't just a movie, after all! Whether a bride or groom gets a case of the dreaded cold feet or disaster strikes, nuptials do get called off from time to time. It's awful, but it's reality for some no-longer brides and grooms. And sometimes, that reality sounds like something straight out of movie.

So there I was with my friends and family at a wedding that didn't actually exist." END
BEGIN HERE "The groom left the bride at the altar. He just didn't show up! He said he had cold feet. The couple stayed together, and then planned another wedding. He stood her up AGAIN! Somehow, they stayed together, and she agreed to attempt to marry him a third time. He showed up, they wed, and have now been together for over forty-five years." END

BEGIN HERE "I was taken to a wedding by a then-girlfriend. I knew no one there. I was sort of just dumped with the groom and his wedding party, as my girlfriend was a bridesmaid. The groom and his buddies proceeded to get drunk and just bail. Not telling anyone, just leaving. So here I am, not knowing anyone.

Normally for an event like this, he'd be the first to turn it off and leave it somewhere, but I guess he needed to call his cousin who was late and in the wedding. When he got to the room, he found the bride hooking up with a friend of a bridesmaid." END

They had known each other for almost a year up to this point. The evening of the wedding, a group of people showed up and literally blocked the street so the groom couldn't come to the wedding venue. Turns out, the groom had been sleeping with a female of said blockade, with the promise of getting married. Even going so far as to introduce himself to her parents and family, plan a future date for his parents to meet hers. For about an hour there was a stand off. When the information got back to the bride and her family, they called off the wedding. The guests were half in shock, half trying to eat and drink as much as they could before the inevitable cancellation happened." END

BEGIN HERE "Last wedding I went to the groom was doing drugs with his friend in the back room right before the ceremony. He could barely walk down the aisle, and he passed out before they could get through their vows. The bride and her mom left crying. They actually got married for real like two weeks later and now have a two-year-old." END
BEGIN HERE "I used to work with a girl named Ashley. She was engaged to some guy I never met. He used to travel a lot for work, or so I was told. We became pretty close friends and a couple of us were invited to the wedding. A couple days before the wedding, I heard some coworkers talking loudly about something terrible that happened. I went over to hear what was going on and I found out Ashley had called off the wedding. Family and friends from Utah had already flown in. Turns out, the fiancé was actually an awful low-life. He had no job and was stealing from her. She decided not to go through with it. Silver lining: three months after the canceled wedding, Ashley and I started dating. She told me later she had doubts about the marriage and had feelings for me. Which I didn't know I had them as well until after the ordeal. We have been married for five years now and have a son together. When people ask how we met, we leave that story out." END

BEGIN HERE It's always sad when a relationship comes to an end, especially when the couple made plans to spend their lives together. While a wedding called off before the big day means the couple should return the gifts they've received, what happens if they make it down the aisle, but not much further? Here's what our experts recommend couples do in regards to the etiquette of returning wedding gifts if the marriage fails. END
BEGIN HERE According to the queen of etiquette, Emily Post, keeping wedding gifts is not dependent on the success of the marriage. So whether it's a week, a few months, or almost a year of marriage before the couple calls it quits, guests should not expect to get their gifts back. END
BEGIN HERE The biggest thing to remember is that these gifts have probably already been used. Even if you're superstitious and don't believe a wedding gift should be used before the Big Day, that isn't a hard and fast rule. Many couples immediately put new dishes straight into the dishwasher or bust out that blender for a batch of margaritas on their next day off — after all, they probably don't have space to store an entire second kitchen worth of gear in the packaging while they wait to say "I do!" If the gift has been opened and used, it's unreasonable to expect that they'll send your gift back to you — and no way you'll get your money back! END
BEGIN HERE And of course, remember that there's much more to the situation than simply whether the couple needs to send back their wedding gifts. They have lives to rebuild and a divorce to navigate, so don't add any more pressure with the expectation that they now need to sift through their belongings not only to figure out who gets what, but to figure out what gets sent back to their friends and family members. Asking for your gift back will put you high on the list of people they resent, when what they really need is love and support. END

BEGIN HERE Vanderpump Rules stars Katie Maloney and Tom Schwartz are officially married — and their wedding is everything we would have expected from the super chic bride. After years of dating, and keeping their relationship in the public eye on the hit Bravo reality show — which included a very traumatic "ring on a string" encounter" at co-star Scheana Shay's wedding well before the actual proposal — these two lovebirds are officially wed. And it looks like their wedding is everything Pump Rules fans could ever hope for — a gorgeous white-themed wedding ceremony, tons of selfie Snapchats, a bevy of beautiful bridesmaids and, of course, Lisa Vanderpump's famous dog Giggy. END
BEGIN HERE What seemed liked the entire cast of the Bravo show posted and shared photos and videos of both the rehearsal dinner and wedding celebrations to Instagram and Snapchat from Tuesday evening into early Thursday morning. We saw the crew wining and dining at the rehearsal dinner, playing what appears to be Heads Up during a girls sleepover the night before the big day, tons of bridesmaid selfies while getting ready for the walk down the aisle, AND an absolutely stunning photo of Maloney and Schwartz's wedding ceremony.

BEGIN HERE Fall weather all across the country can be unpredictable. Where I grew up in the mid-Atlantic region, Indian summers were common. But that didn't mean we didn't have snow in November a few times. It snowed on Halloween when I was in college at Ohio State. Some states out west and in northern New England could have sunshine or heavy snow as early as September. So does that mean you should reconsider getting married in the fall? Absolutely not. Who cares if there's a snow flurry backdrop to the colorful canvas of leaves on the trees? Revel in it, work with it, and enjoy it — just be as prepared as possible for any weather eventuality. END

BEGIN HERE A little white lie never hurt anybody right? We've all been there before. You get invited to so-and-so's wedding and for whatever reason you're just not super stoked on it. So you either grin and bear it and go or make up a somewhat reasonable excuse that gets you out of it. For better or worse, here are some of the best and worst excuses guests have given for RSVP'ing no. END
BEGIN HERE   "No one asks questions when you use this excuse! I was actually feeling pretty shitty (ha!) and wasn't that close to the bride. She was also having a huge wedding and I knew I wouldn't be missed. I offered to pay for my plate at the wedding, which she declined, and she was so sympathetic that I had a bad stomach bug. I feel bad in retrospect that I lied but what can you do now?" — Meg  END
BEGIN HERE We've been imagining the big day details of Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna's wedding ever since that dazzling diamond engagement ring was slipped on Chyna's finger. Will the Kardashian girls serve as bridesmaids? Will Kris Jenner, the official family matriarch, pronounce her son and soon-to-be daughter-in-law husband and wife as the wedding officiant? Will Kanye West pull a "I'm gonna let you finish, but..," and interrupt the vows? We're DYING to know! And to be honest, we're getting a little impatient with the Kardashian/Chyna wedding waiting game. Just when are these two crazy kids going to tie the knot?! Well, in a recent Facebook Live appearance, the couple explained why they're holding off on getting hitched — and we never would've expected the reason! END
BEGIN HERE What's a wedding without champagne? (If you ask us, still just as fun — but a little less delicious!) That's apparently what the pregnant Blac Chyna was wondering as she planned her nuptials to the reality star. END
BEGIN HERE "If it was up to Rob literally we would go tomorrow!" Chyna joked during her and her to-be hubby's Facebook Live interview yesterday. "Every woman deserves to have a beautiful wedding not when they're pregnant," explained Kardashian as his bride-to-be chimed in, "Because I want to turn up after. I want to turn up on my honeymoon and I want to turn up on you." Oh. Okay then... END

It's her day after all, and even we have to admit that a glass of champagne before walking down the aisle does wonders when it comes to calming those nerves. So it sounds like we're going to have to wait a little longer to see the latest Kardashian wedding take place. END
BEGIN HERE "I think next year to kind of give you guys an idea," said Chyna. "It's not going to be this year. I kinda want to get my body back," she explained. END

During their live chat, a fan asked if the pair planned to carry on the Kardashian tradition of 'K' names. But before you start flipping to the 'K' section of a baby book to suggest some ideas, these two revealed that they'll probably forgo the Kardashians' tradition. "Probably not," both Chyna and Kardashian said. END

BEGIN HERE Being a bridesmaid can often feel like a part-time job that has you running around town, doing errand after errand, and working overtime just to keep the bride happy and stress free. It doesn't matter if the bride is your closest friend from childhood or your second cousin, as her bridesmaid you will find yourself feeling like you're always on-call, doing what you can to be by her side. But what happens when you spend too much time and dare i say it, money, on being a bridesmaid? You may find yourself exhausted, resentful, and just desperate for the whole thing to be over. If you're eager to make sure that doesn't happen, here are 4 ways to not get burned out as a bridesmaid. END

BEGIN HERE Will wedding bells be ringing soon for Orlando Bloom and Katy Perry? While there have been numerous stories and speculations about a Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom engagement — the latest update is that a proposal is on its way. END
BEGIN HERE After a little more than seven months of dating, the 39-year-old "Lord of the Rings" actor has shared that he is hoping to get married to his pop star girlfriend very soon. A source close to the couple revealed to People that the pair has been talking about marriage and kids. "They are in love and happier than ever. [Orlando] would like to get engaged to [Katy] before the year is up." END
BEGIN HERE      Courtesy of Giphy    END
BEGIN HERE The 39-year-old actor and the pop star have been linked ever since their fateful night at the Golden Globes after party in January 2016, where they were spotted cozying up together. Since then, it's been romantic trips to Cannes, Hawaii, Hillary Clinton rallies, and most recently (and importantly?) — a nude paddleboarding trip around Sardinia (you probably remember the pretty memorable package that Bloom paraded around the open seas...). END
BEGIN HERE      Courtesy of Giphy    END
BEGIN HERE While 39-year-old Bloom's most recent images didn't break the internet as readily as Kim K's, the actor was definitely in "full bloom" if you know what we're saying — with his leading lady sitting in front of him on the paddleboard like it was NBD. But we digress. The real point of the story is that the two are pretty head-over-heels for each other and a wedding may finally be on the horizon. "He would love to settle down with Katy and have more kids. He hasn't been this serious about a girl since Miranda," the source shared with the magazine, referencing his ex-wife, Miranda Kerr. END
BEGIN HERE The couple has been plagued with breakup rumors in the past (after the Pirates of the Caribbean star was spotted with Selena Gomez in Las Vegas). This minor setback seems to be just a blip on their relationship radar, as the two have been seen getting closer than ever in recent months. END
BEGIN HERE As for Perry's thoughts on the proposal matter? The star, 31, appears to be pumping the breaks a bit more than her British BF. "She's not going to rashly make a huge commitment like marriage again unless she thinks it's absolutely right," a friend close to the singer shared. Both have been married before: Bloom ended his marriage to Kerr (with whom he has a five-year-old son), and the "Dark Horse" singer divorced from her ex, Russell Brand, after just a year of marriage in 2011, according to The Daily Mail. END
BEGIN HERE Fast-forward to present day — she's pretty smitten with her new man — birthday suit and all. "They've been getting along really well. Katy gives [Bloom] space, and they're both pretty independent. They are serious about each other and their relationship." Sounds like a marriage match made in heaven. Okay Orlando — what are you waiting for? Time to buy that ring and propose (fully clothed, we hope). END

BEGIN HERE No one likes a wedding crasher. That open bar is for your guests, not open to the public! And while the easiest way to avoid wedding crashers is to host your wedding at a venue that's remote or unlikely to have quite so many passers-by, sometimes that dream venue is in the heart of downtown — or, it's at a location with multiple gorgeous spots to get married. So if you've rented a venue that hosts more than one wedding per night, what steps can you take to make sure those on the dance floor are your guests, and your guests only? Here are a few tips from our experts. END
BEGIN HERE Before you get too worried, talk to your venue rep. If they regularly have two or more weddings and events on a given night, chances are they have a process in place that helps keep guests in the right spot, whether it's having each event on a different side of the venue so guests don't really cross paths or arranging the timing so that you're not bumping into another bride on your way to cocktail hour. END
BEGIN HERE Still want to make sure everyone knows where to go? Invest in a sign or two to place at the entrance to the space you'll be using, clearly stating the names of the couple getting married. Marrying in a public space, like a museum or library? Add "Private Event" to the sign so tourists and the like won't get tempted to peek. END
BEGIN HERE You should also ask the venue if they can station a member of their staff at the entrance to help guide guests as they arrive. Nothing's worse than dropping your car off at the valet with no idea where to go next, but someone in business attire who looks official is always the first person people ask for directions. They can ask arriving guests which event they're attending, then guide them accordingly. Later in the evening, the same staff member (or someone serving a similar purpose) can be stationed near the restrooms to help guests find their way back to the right party, as well as keep an eye out for anyone who looks like they really don't belong. END
BEGIN HERE  The Real Story Behind Taylor Swift Crashing That Wedding END
BEGIN HERE Last week we revealed the "most-pinned wedding dress on Pinterest," which got us wondering...what are brides all over the world fawning over on the social media platform? What's the most popular wedding cake? Or flowery bouquet? Well, those questions will just have to wait for a later date because apparently, and we say this loosely, the most-pinned engagement ring on Pinterest has been uncovered — and if you consider yourself a princess bride, you're totally gonna L-O-V-E it. It's seriously Cinderella-approved. END
BEGIN HERE    According to HelloGiggles, the most popular engagement ring on our fave wedding-planning site is a $4,300 intricate Verragio diamond ring. Raymond Lee Jewelers describes the ring as being 18k white gold with .45 carats of sparkling diamonds, featuring a diamond twisted split shank along with lace embellishments. It's been pinned an estimated 63,000 times, and after looking at all of its little details it's not hard to see why! END
BEGIN HERE But even though we were smitten with this particular bling, we had to do some deeper digging on Pinterest. And what we found is that although this Verragio ring does have a whopping 63K pins, there are a few (if not more) other notables that scored an even higher number of fans. END
BEGIN HERE Take, for example, the Park Avenue halo engagement ring. It has a total of 105.9K pins, clearly blowing the aforementioned ring out of the water in terms of popularity. Halo rings are super trendy these days to be fair. END
BEGIN HERE Or take the stunning solitaire diamond ring found after the latter — it's a custom designed ring with 2.5 carat moissanite from MCo which has a total of 85.5k pins. END
BEGIN HERE Then there's this $3,595 Paloma engagement ring with intertwined diamond bands and one solitaire diamond in the setting. That pin amassed 91.7k pins for it's unique, vintage-esque design. END
BEGIN HERE  27 Pear-Shaped Engagement Rings END
BEGIN HERE So what really is the most-pinned engagement ring on Pinterest? That we don't know for sure, but we do know which way brides are swaying in terms of trends. According to Pinterest, "We're seeing an increase in non-traditional engagement rings this year, as Pinners want to opt for more unique styles that are also budget friendly." Searches for morganite rings rose 62% this past year, whereas Pinterest users searching for pear-shaped diamonds had over 100% of an increase year over year. Another interesting trend the social media site is seeing? Opal engagement rings! END
BEGIN HERE So while we may not be able to pinpoint exactly what the top-pinned engagement ring is, we do know where the trends are heading. So start pinning those pear-shaped diamond rings, ladies! END

BEGIN HERE  6 Modern Bridal Shower Ideas Your Guests Will Love END
BEGIN HERE Eight years after Jacqueline Jaskowiak and Albert Gehrke started their relationship as high school sweethearts, the duo decided to make their union official. While it was a long road to the altar, the bride will tell you the wait was well worth it. To pop the question, Albert whisked Jacqueline away from Minnesota, where they lived, to a Chicago country club where the soon-to-be groom had played golf with his family as a child. Unaware of Albert's grand plans, Jacqueline bet that she'd crush him in their next golf game — and that her reward should be a proposal. "I swear I am not making this up," she says. "He will tell you he almost had a heart attack when I said it." Although the competition was fierce, there were no losers in this game. At the last green of their nine-hole game, Albert got down on one knee and asked Jacqueline to be his wife. END
BEGIN HERE The couple returned to Chicago for their September 19, 2015, wedding. When they first began to plan their 250-person fete, all they knew was that they wanted their day to be a reflection of their favorite city. But soon, that vision evolved to include a romantic color palette of blues and creams coupled with killer food, great music, and a real party atmosphere in which guests could kick back and have fun. With the help of Estera Events, the couple was able to pull off the party of their dreams, and can remember it fondly with photos from Kyle John Photography. END

BEGIN HERE Jacqueline admits it was tough to plan their big day from afar. "Details and elements that I bought for the wedding would be shipped to my parents' house and I would have to just hope that they worked," she says. "Sometimes we wouldn't get to meet all of the vendors we wanted on our weekend visits home and we had to hope that our phone calls, emails, and short meetings would all come together in the end. But they did, which is why amazing vendors are your saving grace!" END
BEGIN HERE The easiest decisions to make were choosing their ceremony and reception sites — Holy Name Cathedral, an architecturally stunning church in which Jacqueline had long dreamed of tying the knot, and Morgan Manufacturing, where brick walls and high ceilings hinted at city loft living. END
BEGIN HERE The couple's color palette worked it's way into their invitation suite, which featured gold script and blue invitations. The gorgeous design also hinted at Jacqueline and Albert's wedding aesthetic. "I not-so-shamelessly dubbed our theme romantic industrial glam," says the bride. END

"When my mom and I found it, we kind of knew it would be my final choice," Jacqueline says. END
BEGIN HERE The beautiful wedding dress featured a built-in-belt in neutral moonstone hues, and the salon's owner generously made Jacqueline a beaded crown to match. The bride also wore a champagne veil that matched the color of her gown's overlay, stud earrings, and a custom rose gold necklace made with diamonds from her grandmother. END

"I didn't even think about the fact that my dress had a peach hue and it ended up looking great with their colors." END

BEGIN HERE As the newlyweds recessed down the aisle, guests were encouraged to wave blue ribbons wands, a detail that started out as a DIY project but ended up being something for which the couple happily paid. "I attempted to tackle them, but once I realized a very talented person on Etsy could do it even better than me, I jumped on it and am so glad I did," the bride says. END

But the challenge was making the huge warehouse feel like an intimate space for dinner and dancing. That's where the couple's color palette came into play: "The shades we picked made it feel romantic. The flowers and, of course, the gold elements, like the chandeliers in the warehouse, brought it all together," the bride says. END
BEGIN HERE Some of the couple's banquet-style tables — which were all lined with industrial gold metal chairs — featured long garlands of greenery and roses, while others were topped with low floral centerpieces in pastel hues.

This is a great idea if you're a globe-trotting couple and have a penchant for travel. It's also a fun way to celebrate your wedding location — just get a map of the city and encourage guests to sign their names or write a quick note in the margins. Here are five of our favorite takes on this clever guest-book idea. END

BEGIN HERE There'll be no sad songs sung on The Great White Way today, for two of Broadway's favorite stars just tied the knot! Andy Mientus — whose lengthy credits include Spring Awakening, Les Miserable, Carrie, and Smash — and Michael Arden, of Spring Awakening, Big River, and Anger Management fame, are officially married after saying their "I do's" in Somerset, England. And guys, their 10-year-long relationship is the stuff Broadway musicals are written about... END
BEGIN HERE According to Out, the pair first met at the opening night party for The Times Are a-Changin', in which Arden was starring, back in 2006. "Needless to say, the show was a huge flop," remembers Arden. "The best thing to come out of it was me and Andy." The two developed a friendship, but it wasn't until five years later that Mientus made a move, confessing his feelings to his future hubby via text. "I remember dropping my phone into the toilet," said Arden. "I was in L.A. and he was in New York, but I was coming there because I was asked to present an award at the NYMF Gala. Once I got there they said I'd be giving this award to an actor named Andy Mientus. I was like, 'You have to be kidding me.'" And the rest, as they say, is history! END
BEGIN HERE The crooning couple's relationship took off from there. In June of 2014, the pair announced their engagement with a too-funny popped question story. "When we got engaged we both tried to propose on the same day," said Arden. "It was a beautiful day and I had been planning a scavenger hunt that would end with Andy entering a chapel on the hotel property and I would propose to him. So I had developed this whole idea and the staff at the hotel knew. We had spent the afternoon together and then I went to the front desk to get the key to the chapel, so I could begin the whole thing, but when I got back that was the moment Andy proposed to me. He beat me!" But all's well that ends well, right? And things are certainly all well after their romantic wedding ceremony, which Arden announced yesterday on Twitter. END
BEGIN HERE "Mister and Mister," the Broadway star wrote after tying the knot with his sweetheart. The wedding took place at Somerset, England's Babington House, according to Broadway.com — the same venue where actor Eddie Redmayne and his wife Hannah Bagshawe tied the knot! Mientus later posted a pic on Instagram of himself and his hubby flashing their new wedding rings. END

But when things hit the fan at a wedding, there is some documentation that not all brides want — news coverage. No matter how much planning you put into your big day, sometimes something unexpected — and nutty — happens that the media eats up, getting your wedding a front-and-center place on the 11 o'clock news. Here, real brides share the crazy reason their weddings made the news — for better or for worse. END
BEGIN HERE "I got married during Philadelphia's historic blizzard Jonas this past January at St. John the Evangelist Church a block from City Hall. Since the blizzard was forecast in advance, most of the vendors — photographer, florist — came downtown early to be sure to be there. Most of the 200 guests made it too. As my aunt told one of the Philly papers that covered our nuptials: 'We did a lot of walking!'" — Christen END
BEGIN HERE "My wedding didn't make the news, but my parents' wedding did. They were married in 1938 on a rollercoaster at an amusement park in Coney Island owned by my aunt. The roller coaster wedding was a publicity stunt, and proved so popular my parents were 'loaned' out to other rollercoaster owners and married six times. My mother called herself 'the most married woman in America.'" — Mara END
BEGIN HERE "My wedding got coverage from news outlets because of what happened immediately after the ceremony. My new bridegroom and I took a walk with our photographer for some photos in nature and a rattlesnake bit Johnny! We were late for the reception because we had to first get an ambulance to go to the hospital to check that my husband's ankle was free of venom. Luckily it was and we got to the party and have an amazing story to tell our kids someday." — Laura END
BEGIN HERE "On the way to the chapel my fiancé, who is a doctor, happened upon a car pulled off to the side of the road. The woman inside was giving birth and her husband had no clue what to do. Jim took off his tuxedo jacket, rolled up the sleeves of his designer starched shirt and delivered the baby. There was a local news crew nearby who caught the whole thing on camera. It made a splash and there was an insane amount of media who wound up covering Jim and me leaving the church as man and wife, dubbing my husband a 'Hero Bridegroom.' It was wild! We visited the new parents after returning from our honeymoon." —Carol END
BEGIN HERE "The night before our wedding, the church opposite our reception venue, The Conservative Club, was gutted by a fire. Inside the Club was our specially designed cake and all the food for the guests. Doesn't sound like a problem, except the Club was cordoned off like a crime scene by the police as the church smoldered. Thankfully the fire crew cared about our distress and moved everything to a new venue — an Inn that stepped up after hearing our predicament blasted on the news. Happily it worked out just fine and Andrew and I got some unexpected fame!" —Katherine END
BEGIN HERE "When we initially chose our wedding date 20 months in advance, we didn't realize there was anything noteworthy about the day. But it was 11-11-11, which wound up catching everyone's fancy. A local newspaper actually tracked our progress toward the big day as we chose a wedding gown, flowers, music, etc., running little stories to the lead-up. And yes, we became so friendly with the reporter covering us that we would have invited her to the wedding even if she wasn't writing about it!" —Emily END

BEGIN HERE Some couples specifically request their pets to be a part of their big day. And other times it just happens to be a llama convention that is going down in the same hotel as your wedding venue. Ya know, casual. For better or for worse, that's exactly what happened to Alexis and Drew Kluger, who got married in South Carolina — and stayed in the same hotel as a llama convention. END
BEGIN HERE Yes, you heard correctly. Llamas. The day started pretty normally: The couple's ceremony took place at the Cliffs at Mountain Park with the reception indoors at the barn onsite. However, once the cake was cut and the bubbly was toasted to the newlyweds, the guests retreated to their hotel — to party with llamas, according to ABC News. END
BEGIN HERE "We had a big wedding and afterward we all went back to the hotel in Flat Rock and Drew's uncle Jeff got us a party room," Alexis explained. "He got a bunch of liquor and food and music. Someone came in and said, 'There's llamas outside,' so we went out to the lobby and there were a ton people with like eight llamas in the lobby. We were both a little tipsy at this point and just didn't know what to think." So they did what any bride and groom who were on a wedding-high would do: took pics with the llamas! END
BEGIN HERE Of course, they weren't the only ones. Their wedding guests and bridal party followed suit — and enjoyed an impromptu petting zoo as part of their wedding after party."We crashed the llama party, the llamas did not crash our party," the bride joked. "They were totally into it. They were like, 'Come hang out with us.' We all decided to go play with the llamas because they had music going all night and they were partying all night with their llamas." And the result, thanks to the groom's cousin posting the animal shenanigans on Reddit, was one for the books. END
BEGIN HERE All jokes aside, the couple had truly beautiful photos (by photographer Jason Hales), but the llamas really stole the show. "The llama people were just super friendly," said Drew. "If it wasn't for them inviting us to come hang out with them, those pictures and the most memorable night ever would never have happened." An after party to remember, that is for sure. END
BEGIN HERE Unlike a wedding day which happens but just once in a lifetime, The Southern States Llama Association convention happens every year — which is very exciting for the newlyweds, who are already planning to return to the hotel to meet up with their new Andromeda friends.

"My mom has Alzheimer's. She was diagnosed four or five years ago when she was 52. In the past couple years I think it became more apparent to Miles that more than anything else, it being extravagant or waiting for a time when we're less busy, it was important to us that she be there for the wedding."

It's been something like 80 years we've been doing this block party. For Christmas we all put mini Christmas trees out in the front yard. We all do cookie exchanges and decorate them together and take a little bit of each other's cookies." END

BEGIN HERE One of the most-quoted (and most misquoted) pieces of wedding etiquette is about how long you have to send a wedding gift. The rumor is that guests have up to a year after the wedding to send a gift. But common practice says otherwise, with most etiquette experts and planners alike saying that three months is the more appropriate window. That's a nine-month difference, so what is it? Our experts weigh in. END
BEGIN HERE If you send a wedding gift a year after the couple walks down the aisle, is it a wedding gift at all? At that point, it's much more of a housewarming/anniversary/just because gift — even if the card says "Congratulations on your marriage!". Think about it: If you got a birthday gift a year late, you'd consider it a gift for your next birthday, not the last one, no matter if the sender apologizes for it being so late. END
BEGIN HERE With that in mind, of course there's no expectation that all wedding gifts will arrive on the day of the wedding. Some will come weeks (or months) in advance, some will be brought to the reception, and others will trickle in over the following weeks. In each of those scenarios, the gift can very acceptably be considered a wedding gift because the couple has their wedding on their mind. If you fall into the last camp, sending a gift after you've danced the night away and had a good luck slice of wedding cake, aim to send the gift three months or less after the big day. Not only will this make it extra clear that your gift is in honor of their wedding, it will more readily enable the newlyweds to promptly send you a thank you card — and even include a little snippet or memory from their wedding to boot. END
BEGIN HERE Of course, if the gift you're sending is time-sensitive (say, this year's vintage of their favorite wine that isn't released until the fall, or tickets to see their favorite band when you're still waiting on tour dates), you have a little more flexibility. Send a card letting them know about the upcoming gift to they know to keep an eye out for it. END

BEGIN HERE Is there a hubby of the year competition at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics? Because Chris Pratt is pretty much guaranteed to take home the gold! Sure, we've known that Pratt and his wife of seven years Anna Faris are the cutest couple, like, ever for awhile now. They're hilarious, have the most adorable little son ever, and are just too darn sweet. But who knew that Pratt also had a knack for hairstyling? As it turns out, the actor learned how to french braid his wife's hair for the sweetest of reasons. And in our opinion, helping with your wife's haircare ritual is totally gold medal worthy. END
BEGIN HERE As if you didn't love these two enough already, Pratt recently revealed to Instyle that he and Faris bond over a nightly ritual that consists of the Jurassic World actor braiding his sweetheart's long blonde locks. "My sister taught me how to braid when we were younger. Then, I would braid Anna's hair at night... It was a nice little ritual." That's enough to make us swoon, but Pratt then got even sweeter. END
BEGIN HERE All that braiding starting wrecking havoc on his wife's hair. But Pratt, her ever-loving hubby, soon came to Faris' rescue with a stylish solution. "Her hair started breaking off at the top of the braid because she was sleeping on it," the actor explained. "Anna's mom thought a French braid might distribute the pressure. She taught me when we were in Hawaii shooting Jurassic World." END
BEGIN HERE So now Pratt is a bona-fide braiding expert, showing off his hairstyling skills all over Instagram. "This is a weird thing to brag about but I did that glorious french braid," Pratt captioned a social media snapshot of Faris' braided locks, including the hashtag "RealMenBraid." END

BEGIN HERE Chris Hardwick — stand-up comedian, Nerdist CEO, and Talking Dead talk show host — just wed his sweetheart, actress Lydia Hearst, and according to the bride their love will never die! The cute couple wed in a Pasadena, California ceremony on Saturday and their love of science fiction — and each other, of course! — was obvious throughout their beautiful big day. END
BEGIN HERE "My love for you will never die," Hearst captioned a zombie-filtered photo of herself and her groom (see below) the night before the nupitals. "I cannot wait to share my life with Chris," the publishing heiress shared with People magazine. "He's my love, my partner, my friend, everything!" Well, now she can officially add 'hubby' to that list after their weekend wedding! END
BEGIN HERE For the big day, Hearst donned an unconventional and colorful custom wedding dress by Christian Siriano, featuring a layered hem dyed a funky pink hue. Meanwhile, the groom looked dashing in a custom Prada suit. And the bridal party included Hearst's famous friend, Michelle Trachtenberg. "I could never have envisioned a more perfect wedding day," the bride said. END
BEGIN HERE After a ceremony filled with red roses, Vanda orchids, and Tardis blue hydrangeas (What? They are sci-fi lovers, after all!), the couple made their way to the reception where guests like actress Yvette Nicole Brown and actor Nathan Fillion were there to celebrate. The wedding party dined on a fabulous four-course meal and traditional wedding cake, but that wasn't even the sweetest part of the day. END
BEGIN HERE In lieu of wedding gifts, Hardwick and Hearst opted to have guests donate to charity in celebration of their nupitals. "[Lydia] and I are incredibly fortunate people and didn't feel right taking gifts from anyone," the groom wrote online. "Our wedding registry instead is a menu of five wonderful charities that we asked our guests to pick any or all of to make a donation toward." The list of non-profits included St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Operation Smile, GLAAD, Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, and the Best Friends Animal Society, according to E! News.

BEGIN HERE What bride-to-be doesn't love a good deal? It's far too easy to run up quite the tab when planning the wedding of your dreams, so finding the perfect dress on sale or an easy peasy DIY that you can totally tackle is like hitting the lottery. After all, planning all those big day details while on a budget is no easy task. But there's no need to be discouraged: Countless brides-to-be manage be fabulous and frugal — even the silver screen variety! Sure, we're all familiar with the big budget weddings we see in the movies. But have you ever wondered whose nupitals have earned the title as the cheapest movie wedding of all time? END
BEGIN HERE It's easy to be jealous of the no-budget budget of big screen brides. Last month, we found out just how much the over-the-top nuptials of the movie world cost. When Carrie Bradshaw was planning her iconic New York City wedding to Mr. Big, her New York Public Library venue would've cost her $50,000 alone. Sure, she managed to snag her Vivienne Westwood wedding dress for free, but the average gown by the designer goes for about $24,000. Just let that sink in... And remember how Bridesmaids' Annie balked at the price tag of those couture bridesmaid dresses? She would've had to shell out $300 for the frock! Forget about what it would've cost for a surprise performance by Wilson Phillips. But what about the more low-key big screen nuptials? When it comes to the budget weddings of fictional films, apparently no one managed to do it cheaper than The Bride of Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill. END
BEGIN HERE Okay, so it's a little depressing to think that the one character who managed to keep her big day budget under control didn't even make it down the aisle, but we guess that's what you get when Quentin Tarantino is the one pulling the strings. The folks over at Ebates crunched the numbers of a few famous movie weddings and it turns out that the cheapest nupitals of them all was the ceremony at the start of Kill Bill Vol. 2. END
BEGIN HERE Taking place in a small desert church with only the bride, groom, and three friends in attendance, the low-key nupitals would've only cost a mere $748 — a grand total achieved by tallying the venue, officiant, and the average catering cost of $68 per guest. Unfortunately, no one got to eat that food as the entire wedding party was slaughtered by a team of assassins before the reception. It's a Quentin Tarantino movie, remember? But it's still no surprise that a character simply known as 'The Bride' would manage to pull off a wedding for under $1,000 bucks. Kudos, girl... END

BEGIN HERE Weddings are a celebration of love, and every once in a while, they're the birthplace of a new love, too. Chances are you know at least one couple who met at a wedding, whether their romance was lasting or just a short fling. But finding love isn't the question. The real question is whether you, the bride, are allowed to intentionally play a role in the match-making. Here's what our experts have to say about whether or not you can set people up at your wedding. END
BEGIN HERE There's something so fun about playing matchmaker. If you know two people who would be perfect for one another, it's hard to resist the urge to make an introduction! And on a day that's all about love, that temptation is even stronger. However, before you go ahead and set up the maid of honor and the best man, there are a few things to keep in mind: END
BEGIN HERE   Think about how many first dates you had before your last first date with your hubby-to-be. Not every date turns into a lifelong romance, and your wedding is no exception. If you really want your best friend and his best friend to meet, and think they might really have a chance, consider setting them up on a non-wedding blind date. Sure, some of the pressure is still there, but without an audience, they can have a real date instead of wondering when the cake will be cut. And if you're going to be upset that it wasn't true love after all, it won't mar your wedding memories. Though if you're setting them up just for the sake of it, but don't think there's a real chance, you should probably scrap the whole plan. END

BEGIN HERE It looks like Anderson East has some major competition for the heart of the country crooner. Miranda Lambert just said 'yes' to one of the cutest marriage proposals we've ever seen. But no, the country singer's boyfriend, blues singer Anderson East, wasn't the one who popped the question. A young fan by the name of Sebastian beat him to it, asking to wed Lambert during a concert meet-and-greet. The heartthrob-in-training even had a enviable engagement ring for his bride! Time to step up your game, East... END
BEGIN HERE Lambert got more than a standing ovation during the New Jersey leg of her concert tour on Saturday. Her country crooning performance also managed to earn a stunning sparkler from a six-year-old fan! Before the show, Lambert met a few concert goers backstage and one was just so taken by the blonde beauty that he popped the question right then and there, People magazine reports. END
BEGIN HERE When it was his turn to meet the songstress, six-year-old Sebastian dropped to one knee and proposed to Lambert with a pretty-in-pink engagement ring. Too cute! "I got engaged today," Lambert revealed to the audience during the concert. "There's a little six-year-old boy somewhere here named Sebastian. He asked me to marry him and I say, 'Yes, in 25 years,'" she said, flashing her new bling to the crowd. END
BEGIN HERE "When he came to my meet-and-greet, he got down on one knee and he was such a gentleman," continued Lambert. "It may be my favorite proposal ever... 'Cause, girls? We deserve that." Ouch! Was that a not-so-subtle dig to her ex-husband, Blake Shelton? END
BEGIN HERE Lambert later shared a proposal pic of the sweet moment on Instagram. And guys, it's just the cutest! "I said YES!" the singer captioned the photo. "But he has to wait 25 years. This sweet boy Sebastian is a little gentleman." END

BEGIN HERE Once I got engaged, I ramped up my exercise routine — and to my delight — my fiancé joined me! We started off with boxing classes, running along the river, and he even came to a few pilates classes. By far our favorite pre-wedding workout was SoulCycle, so I am very excited that for the first time ever, couples can add SoulCycle classes (and the iconic bright yellow bike!) to their wedding registries exclusively on Zola! It makes perfect sense that brides and grooms would want to add these workout dates to their wedding registries.  END
BEGIN HERE Turns out, my husband and I are not the only ones who like to sweat it out pre-wedding day. According to a recent survey of Zola couples, 70% pump it up extra hard at the gym leading up to the big day, and 60% work out with their S.O. at the gym at least 1-2x per month, many reportedly working out together on a weekly basis.  END
BEGIN HERE Why are couples so obsessed with fitness? Zola launched three years ago with the dream to let couples register for anything. In addition to registry mainstays that will never go out of style, like a KitchenAid Stand Mixer and Le Creuset Dutch Oven, today’s millennial couples want to register for experiences they can share together and fit their lifestyle. Overall, couples are taking health and wellness more seriously, so it makes sense that registering for that category is on the rise as well.  END
BEGIN HERE Outdoor, adventure and active experiences are all growing very rapidly as well. If indoor cycling is not your thing, you can always register for bikes, camping equipment, or a rock climbing excursion to get your heart pumping. Exercise related gifts are the perfect balance to all those food and drink related presents.  END
BEGIN HERE Now that we are married, my husband and I have continued exercising together and it is a great way to bond and relieve stress after a long week. Going to SoulCycle together is a wonderful way to keep the wedding energy going year long, since it is a gift that keeps on giving.  END

"She led me outside and there was a blanket by the pool and she said I had to sit on it. His sons brought me flowers and then he came around the corner with a ring. He had called my mom and asked for her blessing," Kinsey continued. "That would have made my Dad so happy. He proposed and I said yes. The ring is an emerald... All three of our kids' birthstone. The kids made me cards and pictures and I cried. I cried that happy ugly cry." And if you're ugly crying already, just wait until you see these wedding photos below... END

So can you ask your bartender to set some aside? Our experts weigh in. END
BEGIN HERE There's nothing stopping you from setting aside a bottle to make sure your drink of choice is available all night long. Of course, you'll want to check with your caterer first.

Consider putting a note on the bottle ("BRIDE AND GROOM ONLY" should get the point across!) in case a different bartender jumps behind the bar and doesn't realize the drinks are for the two of you. And of course, don't be afraid to share! You may love gin, but chances are you won't need that whole bottle. As the evening comes to an end, spread the love! END

BEGIN HERE Lauren Larson met Tyler Kramer when they were just two 18-year-old college freshmen living in Chicago. “Our connection was immediate, there was always an undeniable attraction and draw to one another,” Lauren says. The pair remained friends until eight years later, when they met up and rekindled the flame. From there, they took a few big steps in their relationship — a year of long-distance dating, a move together to Detroit, a new home, a new puppy, and finally, a proposal.  END
BEGIN HERE Once the elated couple began thinking about their dream wedding, finding the right word to describe their style was easy: Simplicity. “I’m Swedish and I love undeniable beauty of clean, simple lines and subtle elegance that Scandinavian style brings,” Lauren says. They teamed up with Amy Rubins of Fete Perfection to find the perfect urban industrial space for their venue. The brick walls and high ceilings at The Solar Arts Building in Minneapolis turned out to be the perfect blank canvas for this couple’s big day. They invited 170 guests to share in the celebration on November 14, 2015. Lucky for us, we get to experience the romance through Matt Lien Photography's images, below. END

She completed her look with a BHLDN veil, shoes by Nina, and earrings from Shopbop. END
BEGIN HERE After coming across Jenny Yoo Collection's dresses online, Lauren fell in love with a ruffled v-neck style in dusty blue color — a look that she knew would be perfect for her bridesmaids. The chiffon gowns were paired with each 'maid's choice of accessories. “I really just wanted them all to feel pretty and I have to say, they all have great taste so it was easy!” In keeping with the couple’s neutral color scheme of whites and greens, Lauren and her bridesmaids carried bouquets of assorted white peonies and ranunculus with pops of green.  END
BEGIN HERE Tyler wore a custom gray suit from Hubert White, which he paired with Cole Haan shoes and a tie and pocket square from The Tie Bar. Groomsmen were given a swatch of gray fabric and asked to select a suit that matched the shade. The groom gifted them a few final touches — fun navy socks, ties and pocket squares. END
BEGIN HERE The couple wanted their ceremony to feel cozy and intimate, so they adorned a vintage mantle with hundreds of candles and seeded eucalyptus, and hung a huge wreath above. It was important to them to personalize the ceremony as much as possible, so Lauren’s cousin, Kelly, was the officiant. The couple carefully selected readings and songs that were meaningful to their relationship, and they wrote their own personal vows. “We were both pretty nervous to say these words in front of those we love but it ended up being my favorite part of the evening,” Lauren shares. END
BEGIN HERE The mother of the bride took on a few DIY projects for the big day, including creating birch sticks embellished with bells that guests were meant to ring after the ceremony. She also painted candle holders for the reception!  END

BEGIN HERE When this couple made decisions on reception décor, it was all about setting the mood. They chose to have shared seating for guests at long rectangular tables topped with rich white linens adorned with tons of glowing candles and seeded eucalyptus. END
BEGIN HERE The venue’s catering team was one of the big reasons why Lauren and Tyler chose the venue, and the food lived up to their expectations. Guests were served a kale caesar salad, followed by a choice of locally-raised bone-in chicken with poblano grits and roasted fennel, herb-rubbed sirloin steak with roasted vegetables and potato gratin, or farro risotto with kale, cauliflower, peas, and a soft poached egg. END
BEGIN HERE They skipped the traditional wedding cake in favor of an assortment of desserts instead. Their dessert bar included pies shaped like the states of Minnesota and Michigan, caramel, pistachio, and vanilla macarons, tiramisu, and banana pudding trifle. END
BEGIN HERE While bride Lauren originally hoped to have a band play at the reception, the couple ended up choosing DJ Kjell Nafstad with Flow Event Group. They were thrilled with the music selection, as the DJ played tons of motown, some 80s favorites, and more modern tunes. “We steered very clear of any cliche wedding songs. No cheese factor!” the bride says. END
BEGIN HERE The couple continued to celebrate their union with a two week honeymoon in South Africa. There, they spent one week on safari and the other in Cape Town. END
BEGIN HERE Since it was incredibly important to Lauren and Tyler to make their wedding personal to them, the bride’s advice to newly engaged couples is to “bite the bullet and write your vows!” END

We fly a lot and have been talking about purchasing a few toys to bring with us on our adventures, we just haven't been sure how to go about it. What toys travel well? What might get us busted and embarrassed in a long airport line? For example, I've had my eye on the Magic Wand for a long time. This may sound silly, but I'm not sure if I can only fly with it in my checked bag or if I can carry it on with me. I checked online, but couldn't find much on the TSA website (no big surprise there). Can you help us get more pleasure out of our adventures abroad? Elizabeth END
BEGIN HERE Dear Elizabeth, END
BEGIN HERE I LOVE this question! It's summer, which means that everyone's working out their traveling plans. With all the stress-inducing logistics of getting from the airport to your destination, I think it's only fair that you deserve to be having as much fun as legally possible. And we all know that one of the best parts of every vacation is vacation sex! So why not bring some extra stimulation to enhance your adventures? END
BEGIN HERE Like a lot of people, you're naturally nervous about having your most intimate sexual secrets exposed in an International Terminal as the TSA follows that mysterious buzzing sound into your carry-on. Worse yet, what if they open your suitcase and now all your fellow travelers know that you're REALLY into anal play. But are they going to arrest you for having too much fun? END
BEGIN HERE Here's the answer: no. Unless you're flying in Alabama (which still has some bans on buying toys in state), you are certainly, legally allowed to travel with your sex toys. You can take sex toys through security (ask me about the time I was coming home from a sex toy convention in Vegas with multiple suitcases full of buzzing bunnies, wands and dildos)! Yes, you can even carry the master of all personal massagers the Magic Wand through security either tucked into your bag or walking through the terminal waving it like a fairy princess! (Although you may not want to draw that much attention.) END

BEGIN HERE After you have walked down the aisle, whispered "I Do" and locked lips with the love of your life, you'll spend the rest of the night dancing, eating and hugging guests. But once that's all over and the night comes to and end, one thing you can look forward to is wedding gifts. Chances are each of your guests gave you a little something, whether it was an item from your registry or just cold hard cash. Either way, those gifts are yours. If you're wondering what to use all that wedding cash for, here are 7 ideas to get you started. END

BEGIN HERE There's a new engagement on the block — and we couldn't be more excited by the news! New Kids on the Block singer Jonathan Knight is planning on the tying the knot! Knight just revealed that he's engaged to his longtime love Harley Rodriguez and the story of how the "You Got It" singer popped the question is giving us #allthefeels... END
BEGIN HERE Knight first met his personal trainer beau back in 2008, and now eight years later, he finally decided to put a ring on it! On Tuesday, the boy band alum spilled the news on Jenny McCarthy's SiriusXM series, The Jenny McCarthy Show, explaining how he popped the question during their recent vacation in Africa. "We were in Africa, our parents were there — our moms were there — and I just figured this was the time to pop the question and make it official," Knight recounted on the radio show according to E! News. "He had no clue." said Knight, although he also noted that he and his almost-hubs have pretty much always considered themselves a married couple. Aww! END
BEGIN HERE How did this destination proposal go down, you ask? "We were on the Zambezi River — it's right above Victoria Falls. We took a nighttime raft dinner, just the four of us out on the river, there was like a hippopotamus in the background," said Knight. "Oh, and it was a super moon on top of that, so it was absolutely beautiful and so romantic. I just said, 'Now is the time to do it.'" END

BEGIN HERE So why the long wait? "See, that's the funny thing with two guys: It's always hard like, who proposes? Who asks? And I think that was our problem," the NKOTB singer explained. "Like the whole time I'd been waiting for him to ask, he'd probably been waiting for me to ask, and it just gets to a point where somebody's gotta do it."  END

BEGIN HERE Just because the election has come to an end, it doesn't mean you're in the clear when it comes to have your wedding guests' blabber on about politics, the results of the 2016 presidential election, or the future of the country. So if you're wondering how to put a stop to politics taking over the dinner table talk at your wedding reception, cocktail hour, or even as your guests take a seat for your ceremony, here are four ways to make sure those topics aren't discussed. END
BEGIN HERE    Set up a game that requires guests to donate a $1 to the charity of your choice every time they say something about the election. You could put jars around the venue with signs on them so that guests know where to pay up throughout the night — we have a feeling other guests will keep them honest.  END

BEGIN HERE We're hearing wedding bells! Singer Ricky Martin is engaged to artist Jwan Yosef — and he shared all the details of the proposal on The Ellen DeGeneres Show this past week. END
BEGIN HERE The Puerto Rican pop star, 44, told the talk show host on Tuesday about his new fiancé and how they came to be. "He's a conceptual artist and I'm a collector. I started looking for art and I saw his art and I went crazy because I really love what he does. Really original," Martin explained told DeGeneres, describing how the lovebirds first met. "And then I contacted him." The singer also shared that he had no idea what Yosef looked like, but when he finally saw a photo of him — he was smitten. END
BEGIN HERE Art discussions turned to dates — and the rest is history. "I got on my knees and I took out the little metal box. I just had it in a little velvet pouch and instead of saying, 'Will you marry me?' I said, 'I got you something!' Bad," the singer told DeGeneres about his proposal that sounded more like a holiday gift giving situation (oops!). "Then he was like, 'Yes.' I said, 'I want to spend my life with you,' and he was like, 'What is the question?' 'Would you marry me?' That's it."  END
BEGIN HERE (450x100%) END
BEGIN HERE The singer described the event as "very beautiful," and like most proposals, filled with lots of emotion. "I'm so happy for you," DeGeneres told Martin. "You deserve that." To commemorate the day and the promise, Martin is now sporting a ring on his left finger. Details about their upcoming nuptials are still on the DL. END
BEGIN HERE Martin is father to two twin boys, Matteo and Valentino, whom he fathered in 2008 via a surrogate. Before his relationship with Yosef began, Martin dated Carlos González Abella, which began in 2010, around the same time that the "Livin' La Vida Loca" singer came out to the world, according to Daily Mail. "I am proud to say that I am a fortunate homosexual man. I am very blessed to be who I am," he wrote on his official website in March 2010.  END
BEGIN HERE From the sound of it, in the last year, Yosef has become a father figure for the boys as well. "They love each other. It's perfect, Ellen," the singer said. "It's been really special." So sweet! Next on the agenda (besides his Las Vegas residency at the Park Theater at Monte Carlo in Las Vegas)? Wedding planning, of course! See below for photos of the happy couple and Martin's visit at The Ellen Degeneres Show. Congrats, you two.  END

BEGIN HERE So who's the lucky lady who gets to side-hug her sweetheart? Drumroll, please... According to Us Weekly, it's Joy-Anna Duggar, 19! Duggar and her longtime friend, Austin, have just announced that they've officially entered into a courtship — that's the Duggar family approved form of dating for the uninformed, which consists of no sex, no kissing, chaperoned dates, and side-hugs only.   END
BEGIN HERE The TLC star spilled the big news on her family's website, where she and her new beau posted a video dishing on the details. "Hey, y'all! I’m Joy Duggar and this is Austin," Duggar began, sitting side-by-side with Austin in a picturesque autumn landscape. "I just asked her to enter a courtship with me," announced Austin. "And I said yes!" exclaimed his excited sweetheart. "We've known each other for a long time," she explained, noting that Austin popped the (dating) question in this beautiful woodsy spot that holds a special meaning to the pair.  END
BEGIN HERE This isn't the first time the couple has spent time here together, explained Duggar, recounting the first time they came to the spot. "We were just hanging out and it was really late at night, the stars were just gorgeous. For me that's really special... And then now it’s even more special because it’s where we start our courtship." END

BEGIN HERE Finding a wedding invitation in your mailbox is pretty exciting. Who doesn’t love a chance to get dressed up and spend the night on the dance floor celebrating their friends’ love? But it also comes with its own share of questions and confusion, from whether you were invited with a guest to what you should wear. No matter the formality or the season, being a great wedding guest will not only mean you have a fantastic time, but will ensure that the bride and groom do, too. If you’re not sure what makes a great wedding guest (or, more specifically, what makes a BAD one), our experts reveal the six things a wedding guest should never do. END
BEGIN HERE    Everyone loves an open bar, but free alcohol is not an invitation to get as drunk as possible. You could end up being disruptive, or worse, causing damage to the venue or hurting yourself. Instead, drink responsibly, make plans for a designated driver or a ride home, and enjoy yourself within reason. END
BEGIN HERE If you clicked on this article not knowing what in the world a "mannequin challenge" is, you're probably not alone. But worry not because we're here to catch you up to speed with what's going on in this strange, social media-crazed world. The idea originally came from a group of students at a Jacksonville high school, but ever since, people all over the world have been partaking in this erm, interesting, viral sensation which includes getting your squad together and striking a very, very still pose. As you and your besties hold your breath and try your best not to A) sneeze B) blink C) move a freakin' inch in risk of ruining your group's V important Snapchat video, one of your other lucky friends gets to film the whole thing. And what with Facebook and Instagram ruling our lives these days, your squad's video probably has a decent chance at going viral. END
BEGIN HERE At least, that's what we thought before we saw this truly EPIC wedding mannequin challenge making its rounds across the web. We hate to say it, but amateur takes simply won't do anymore. This couple has set the bar way too high for any of us plebes. Don't believe us? Watch it for yourself. END
BEGIN HERE These (now) newlyweds were so committed to creating the most incredible mannequin challenge to date that they decided to have their wedding videographer forgo the sweet, tender moments altogether for a jaw-dropping mannequin performance. And the best part isn't even that they did all of this on their wedding day — it's that they got their guests in on the action, too!  END
BEGIN HERE The YouTube video starts in the bridal suite and swoops through the pre-wedding festivities. After that, it's on to the first look, where the bride starts at the bottom of the stairs and quickly winds up in her husband-to-be's arms. Then it's on to the ceremony where guests stand stiff straight in the pews and the groom awaits his blushing bride. In the grand finale, the camera pans around a ballroom as onlooking guests get teary-eyed over the bride and groom's first dance. And then, out of nowhere, it turns into one big dance party that legit gives us all the feels.  END

BEGIN HERE There are some hard truths to planning — let's call them realities — that I wish all brides and grooms understood, without having to be told. I don't mean these things unkindly, they're simply facts of the wedding planning business. If all clients understood them, I think, the wedding planning experience would be better for both parties.  END
BEGIN HERE Most wedding vendors love what we do — it's not an easy business, and to be able to design and create and please our clients on their most important day is an emotional experience. But in the end, it is business.  END
BEGIN HERE    Don't fight with your fiancé on the telephone with me, or in front of me. It's embarrassing. Don't fight with your mother in front of me, either. Equally uncomfortable. If the two of you don't agree on a decision that needs to be made, take that matter offline. Put it on a list of things to discuss AFTER our meeting. I have to work with both of you. I can't take sides — I don't want either of you to hate me. But I'll tell you this, as someone who survived her own wedding planning and has been married 12 years, if you cannot work together in a civil manner to plan your actual wedding, you might not be ready to get married. Married couples face far more stressful — and important — challenges. You have to be able to work together. Feel free to use your wedding planning as a way to learn to compromise better in your relationship, but don't do it in front of me. I don't get paid enough for that. END
BEGIN HERE Whether you need to detox, de-stress, or simply kick back after the big day, a pampering spa holiday is something every bride deserves. While it's obviously possible to indulge in some TLC at your local Burke-Williams or a fancy hotel spa, part of the fun is getting away to a gorgeous and romantic destination. Here, 10 of the world's best resort spas well worth the flight—or frequent flyer miles. END
BEGIN HERE    Although you won't travel too far to get to this heaven-on-earth in Southern California, you'll feel far away.

BEGIN HERE Bob Guiney (of The Bachelorette and The Bachelor fame) and Jessica Canyon have a mutual friend to thank for their first introduction in November of 2012. The pair hit it off right away and by Labor Day weekend of 2015, Bob had no doubt in his mind that Jessica was “the one.” With the help of the couple’s yellow lab, Phoebe, Bob surprised his longtime love with a sunset proposal on the water near his family’s lake house in Michigan. Naturally, Jessica said yes and the pair began planning for a destination wedding in sunny Mexico. END
BEGIN HERE “I really wanted to get married at a private home with a big yard and Bob wanted to go someplace tropical, so Casa Entre Rocas in Punta Mita, Mexico, was the perfect combination,” Jessica says. With the date set for November 11, 2016, the duo invited 80 guests to join them for a celebration in paradise — with every bright detail planned and executed by the bride herself. “It was exhausting and stressful, but it felt good once it all came together,” she says. Read on to see every gorgeous detail of Bob and Jessica’s tropical “I do’s,” photographed by Ave Sol and shared exclusively with BRIDES!  END
BEGIN HERE Jessica visited more than 15 different bridal salons before she found her wedding dress, but we’d say the wait was well worth it. “I almost gave up, but one morning we were in New York and I walked over to the Pronovias flagship store,” she says. There, she saw her figure-hugging gown, complete with a high neckline and low, beaded back, hanging in the window. “I knew it was the one the moment I saw it.”  END
BEGIN HERE The sleek silhouette was exactly what she’d been envisioning and struck the perfect balance with the lush, natural décor around the wedding. Her punchy bouquet popped against the structured silhouette, and Jessica’s long, flowing beach waves picked up the perfect amount of ocean breeze.  END
BEGIN HERE She finished her look with a few important accessories: the bride wore two bracelets and a ring that were made from a vintage pearl necklace her parent’s had given her as an 18th birthday gift. “They were very special,” Jessica says. “They served as my ‘something old’ and my ‘something new’ at the same time!”  END
BEGIN HERE And, of course, she had to wear her gorgeous engagement ring! END
BEGIN HERE The bride caught sight of Bob’s black Gorgio Armani suit for the first time during their oceanfront first look. “We wanted the wedding to be about casual elegance,” Jessica says. “More of a non-traditional wedding that felt like an elegant and fun house party with close friends and family.”  END
BEGIN HERE Jessica’s seven bridesmaids wore mismatched black gowns from Revolve. END
BEGIN HERE The bride’s bouquet of roses, protea, thistle, and greenery was perfect for Jessica and Bob’s destination wedding. Like the bride, ‘maids carried beach-inspired bouquets of tropical king protea.  END
BEGIN HERE “We relied on the ocean to provide a romantic backdrop for the ceremony,” Jessica says, but that didn’t stop the couple from amping up the space with plenty of flowers and glowing candles. Their ceremony structure, which was made from branches and local white blooms, was a stunning focal point for Bob and Jessica’s vows.  END
BEGIN HERE The pair decided to have an adults-only wedding, but that didn’t mean they nixed flower girls all together. As a fun twist on tradition, Jessica and Bob’s mothers walked down the aisle arm in arm, tossing white flower petals as guests looked on.  END
BEGIN HERE “Watching Jessica walk down the aisle was my favorite memory from the wedding,” Bob says. In addition to sharing words they’d written themselves, the bride and groom also opted to recite traditional vows. And, as a special treat for the pair, actor Scott Grimes, along with local musicians, performed an acoustic version of “Come to Me” by the Goo Goo Dolls. “Scott made a joke saying that he’d written a song for the bride and groom, and then started with ‘You’re making a big mistake!’” Jessica says. “Everyone laughed, and then he started playing ‘Come to Me.’” END
BEGIN HERE As soon as they were pronounced husband and wife, guests showered the elated duo with more white flower petals.  END
BEGIN HERE For the reception, guests moved to another part of the venue’s large lawn and took their seats at round tables topped with tropical centerpieces. Each vase was filled with a mix of bright flowers, including ranunculus, roses, and more protea. Guests dined on requisite Mexican fair, like the evening’s biggest hit: a taco station!  END
BEGIN HERE In honor of their love of the Kentucky Derby, Jessica and Bob created a signature cocktail based on one they’d enjoyed together at the race the previous year. “It was called a Grey Goose Oaks Lily and it’s so refreshing,” the bride says of the vodka, St-Germain, lime, and soda mix. END
BEGIN HERE The couple cut into a three-tiered carrot cake, but also served up mini bundt cakes that the bride made the day before the wedding use her aunt Mary’s secret family recipe. Talk about a DIY-savvy bride!  END
BEGIN HERE After dinner and dancing, guests gathered around a fire pit to make s’mores. But the night wasn’t quite over. Bob and Jessica surprised their loved ones with a firework show to cap off the evening.  END
BEGIN HERE “Everything about our wedding was a reflection of us,” Jessica says. “We have had so many people comment that the invites were ‘so unique’ or ‘so us,’ and since we planned the whole thing ourselves, we wanted everything to have a little bit of ‘us’ in it.”  END

BEGIN HERE One of the great things about a honeymoon fund (aside from getting extra cash for your epic vacation!) is that you can break it down into specific items and experiences to make your guests' gifting experience a little more personal. From a couple's massage to upgraded plane tickets to a cooking class all about local cuisine, it gives a fun insight into the adventure you have planned and helps your guests feel like they're buying you something specific instead of just writing a check. But do you actually have to use the money you received for the things your guests purchased? Here's the inside scoop. END
BEGIN HERE While you should definitely still use the money for your honeymoon, there's no rule saying that SCUBA lesson your aunt purchased actually has to be a SCUBA lesson. You might decide that you'd much rather upgrade your standard room to a suite or an over-water bungalow, or arrive at your destination and realize that a helicopter tour would be more your speed. Or maybe you'd rather spend a few hours in a smaller seat on the airplane, then reward yourself with a luxurious day for two at the spa instead. It's your trip, after all! And if you land and are way too tired for that sunrise hike up a volcano, there's always a sunset cruise or a private dinner on the beach.  END
BEGIN HERE As we mentioned, though, you really should still put the money you receive as part of your honeymoon fund toward your honeymoon. Your guests are hoping to make that experience as memorable and exciting as possible for you, so put their generosity to good use! And if you come home with a little extra money in your pocket (perfect for that home improvement project you were thinking about!), we won't tell!  END

Edible wedding favors are always a solid option, whether they're enjoyed as a late-night snack or a hangover cure the morning after. And we're not talking about a slice of cake or fancy sugar cookies — instead try a thoughtful food pairing that your guests will be raving about long after the big day.  END
BEGIN HERE    While fast food is not the most appropriate choice for a wedding-day meal, we're all for serving fries as a playful midnight snack for your guests.

BEGIN HERE Bailon and her Grammy-winning hubs headed to Paris, France to tie the knot on November 11. (Because what could be more romantic than the Eiffel Tower as a wedding venue, right?) The couple said "I do" at the ultra-luxe Hotel Plaza Athénéel in front of about 70 wedding guests including Bailon's The Real co-hosts Loni Love, Jeannie Mai, and Tamera Mowry. And earlier this week, Bailon spilled the tea to her girls — and their audience — on the stuff we didn't get to see in the newlyweds' wedding video.  END
BEGIN HERE Bailon and Houghton had actually vowed to remain celibate until they tied the knot, making their wedding night all the more momentous for the pair.  END
BEGIN HERE "You don't understand, we've waited for this moment," Houghton began, making a special appearance on his new wife's talkshow. "So I opened the door and I had to kick Shane out, because he was following us around with the camera," he hilariously explained, referring to The Real's cameraman. "Like, 'You gotta go. Thank you for following us this far, but your time is up. Feel free to go to bed.'" Could you blame them, really? They've waited a long time to get busy! END
BEGIN HERE But there was an extra special surprise waiting for Bailon's new hubs when they got to the bridal suite — and it's a good thing their cameraman wasn't there to catch it!  END
BEGIN HERE "When I opened the door, I walked in and I saw these gigantic portraits all over the suite of this beautiful woman, um... not wearing much at all!"

She took me to places that were significant to our relationship, where we met, where we had our first kiss, where we confessed our love. At each stop she gave me a love letter Grant had written in advance, along with pictures of us over the last 3 years. Our final stop took us to the cliffs in Carlsbad, where he was standing on a cliff surrounded by red roses, overlooking the ocean.  He got down on one knee with a ring, told me how he loved me and how he couldn't wait to continue traveling the world together. He had a photographer hiding in the cliffs as well so we have memories forever!" — Cheyenne Martinez  END
BEGIN HERE "We met the first week of college in 2010 and have been together for the last 6 years! We had not been back to our school since we graduated and he had the alumni office create and send me a fake invitation to an event. I RSVP’d yes and we went up for the weekend. When we arrived, I turned the corner and saw the champagne and flowers set up and immediately knew!" — Mackenzie Coombs END
BEGIN HERE "Wen and I met 8 years ago when we were both freshly out of college and worked at a little café. I’d just arrived in New York and wasn’t looking for anything serious, but we quickly became best friends and started dating. She loves hiking so I did some research to find a trail with great views and planned a fall trip to upstate New York with some friends. We hiked up Mount Beacon and at the summit posed for a photo. I then said, “Let’s try one in this pose”, dropped down to one knee and popped the question! I surprised her a little too much to be honest, there were a couple minutes of her saying “what are you doing” and “this is too fast”, but then she said yes and our friends popped open the champagne :-) Started at the café, now we’re here!" — Benjamin Smit  END
BEGIN HERE "We were vacationing in beautiful St. Barths, and he had planned a sunset cruise. We sipped champagne aboard a stunning yacht, and watched the sun slowly sink into the horizon.   Once we anchored down, he led me to the bow and placed a white envelope in my hands. Inside was the sweetest hand written love letter. By the time I had finished reading, he was already down on one knee.  When I could finally speak again, I (of course) said yes." — Suzanna Villarreal  END
BEGIN HERE "Emily proposed to me in Baltimore, MD on 10/23/16 right on the water. I was completely shocked! She had her best friend who is a photographer hide out to take photos of the moment. We've been dating for 3 1/2 years and plan on getting married in October of 2018." — Erika K. END

Nick mentioned to me he wanted to go sailing for the first time on his birthday and found a great charter online. Sounds great I said! So the next day we headed to the dock where we were to meet the captain and board the boat. Shortly, this very small bright yellow blow up boat pulls up and all I can think of is great what did he book. This is way too small! Come to find out it was the dingy boat taking us to our 47' private charter sail boat anchored across the way. Absolutely beautiful! Having the sail boat completely to ourselves was no hint because I simply thought it was his birthday excursion. We were having the best day! Hopping from island to island with great food, good music, perfect weather...just really enjoying every moment. As we were sailing back the sun was setting and we were sitting at the bow of the boat taking pictures when he stood up, kneeled on one knee and with the most sweetest, nervous voice he asked me to marry him! Shocked, surprised, confused and excited I said YES!! Not only were we in the middle of the sea with a backdrop to die for he proposed to me on his day, his birthday, which is now our day!" — Jessica Alleen END
BEGIN HERE  Just when we thought we'd seen and heard the craziest mother-in-law stories of all time, we've found a new winner of the "Worst Mother-in-Law" EVER award. An Austrian woman has just been found guilty of stealing her son and his wife's wedding gifts. END
BEGIN HERE This story is depressing, twofold, so make sure you're prepared. The backstory: The woman's son and daughter-in-law got married two years ago in Turkey (although the originally met in Austria), according to Indy100. At the wedding, a plethora of guests gave gold to the newlyweds, which is a customary Turkish wedding gift tradition — jewelry or coins, in most cases. At the time, they gave their assets to the groom's mom (over 20,000 euros to be exact) with the assumption that she would keep it safe for them. Easy peasy...so you'd think. END
BEGIN HERE Unfortunately, two years post-wedding, the couple has parted ways and is getting a divorce, working together to split their assets (in a friendly way). One small catch, however, is this mother-in-law is acting "clueless" when it comes to the money and jewels — stating she never had received it in the first place. Now that is some first-rate sketchy MIL behavior if we do say so ourselves. END
BEGIN HERE Fast-forward to the verdict (as the case ended up in court): the greedy mama was found guilty of embezzlement. She was fined 1200 Euros, and clearly (we'd assume) suffered an even worse fate — her children most likely never talking to her again. END
BEGIN HERE Just to make sure that you don't come across the same dilemma, here are a few things this mama has taught us. One: never ask your relatives to hold money for you, and two: it's all fun and games until lawyers and the court of law gets involved. But the real moral of the story? Your mother-in-law may not be as bad as she seems. Promise. END
BEGIN HERE Julia Bushe and Logan Hirsch bonded while working in the same industry right out of college. “We’d known each other for a few years, but that was when we really hit it off,” says Julia. The pair dated for over five years (during which Julia became a wedding and lifestyle photographer, founding Julia Elizabeth Photography). On a Sunday morning in September of 2014, during a weekend at Julia’s family’s cottage on Martha’s Vineyard, Logan woke Julia at the crack of dawn to watch the sun rise on the beach. “As a photographer, I was so excited to have the chance to photograph the sunrise,” she says. Logan got really quiet, then, after a short speech, he got down on one knee. “I’ll always remember the image of him kneeling in front of me, with nothing but the quiet ocean behind him." Thankfully, Julia’s friend and fellow photographer, Ashley, had snuck out of the cottage behind them to capture the special moment.  END
BEGIN HERE They returned to the same secluded corner of Martha’s Vineyard one year later, on September 26, 2015 — this time with 118 people in tow for their wedding! “We rented a beautiful home overlooking the Vineyard Sound, and had the entire wedding on the property,” says Julia. They made the most of the early fall weather, with a ceremony overlooking the sea, a raw bar, and a tented dinner lit by kerosene lamps. And of course, given Julia’s profession, you know she’s had tons of inspiration to draw from! Our favorite part, though, might be that the couple’s wedding day was photographed by the same friend who captured their engagement: Ashley Caroline. END
BEGIN HERE The deckled-edge invitations were decorated with a simple wreath around a handwriting-inspired font. Julia and her family stayed at the home where the wedding was held, while Logan and his groomsmen got ready at another ocean-weathered camp a few doors down.  END
BEGIN HERE “As a wedding photographer, I’ve admired a ton of great dresses, but none more than the ones by Claire Pettibone. After trying on over 20 dresses, I put on this one and my mom immediately started crying. The delicate off-the-shoulder straps and bow at the waist were perfect for catching the ocean breeze,” says Julia. Her bouquet was full of garden roses, ranunculus, and dahlias in peach, pink, and vibrant red, with eucalyptus scattered amongst the blooms.  END
BEGIN HERE Instead of a veil, the bride headed down the aisle with a stunning crown of dahlias and ranunculus above her soft waves, framing the low back of her gown. “I’ve never felt so beautiful in anything,” she says.  END
BEGIN HERE Logan paired his blue suit with socks with serious personality. “Anyone who knows Logan knows how much he loves pretzels!” says Julia. The vibrant hue of the bride's bouquet were a perfect match for the changing colors surrounding the couple’s wedding venue.  END
BEGIN HERE Logan’s groomsmen wore navy suits (with pretzel socks, of course!), while Julia’s bridesmaids donned soft blue dresses from Zara. Their different shades of blue really let Logan’s suit pop.  END
BEGIN HERE “I wanted to have the girls wear something easy and affordable that they would hopefully wear again. I chose two dresses that had similar colors and designs — and even bought one for myself to wear later!” she says. What we might love even more than the flowy designs is the all-greenery bouquets each woman carried, with a mixture of ferns and eucalyptus.  END
BEGIN HERE The ceremony took place on the lawn of the home, with floral arrangements in French buckets flanking the aisle. Guests were seated on wooden benches, facing a rustic arch draped in a garland of eucalyptus and garden roses. A Persian rug was set where the bride and groom stood.  END
BEGIN HERE “We spent a lot of time planning the ceremony, and it was better than I ever imagined,” says Julia. “We wrote our own vows, separately, but they ended up being very similar. We both talked about Sunday mornings, going for a run, and running errands. It’s the mundane things, sometimes!” The officiant was Julia’s childhood minister, a close family friend.  END
BEGIN HERE Two days before the wedding, the couple and their family lined up in the kitchen of the home they rented to put together favors: Small bottles filled with olive oil and a sprig of rosemary, which also served as escort cards. Guests played lawn games, ate clam chowder, and indulged in the raw bar during the open-air cocktail hour. The couple’s cousin is a mixologist, so he helped create two signature cocktails: Logan’s Crossing and the Chilmark Collins.  END
BEGIN HERE Beneath the reception tent, guests were seated at bare wooden tables that were topped with garlands of eucalyptus and lit by kerosene lanterns. “My family always uses kerosene lamps on the table when we have dinner parties on the Vineyard, and I knew I wanted to include them to make our wedding feel like one big dinner party,” says Julia.  END
BEGIN HERE Garden roses and ranunculus in shades of peach and red studded the garlands. Each guest’s place was set with a textured linen napkin and a sprig of rosemary. Dinner was a choice between grilled swordfish, roasted Cornish game hen, or grilled mushrooms, all served with wild mushroom risotto. “We grill swordfish at least once during every trip, so we knew we wanted to serve it at the wedding,” the bride explains.  END
BEGIN HERE For dessert, the newlyweds had a three-tiered carrot cake, filled with cream cheese frosting. “We wanted to keep the wedding low key, so we also set up a s’more station around a bonfire once the sun went down,” Julia says. Later in the evening, the pair’s favorite pizza, Chilmark Pizza, was delivered straight to the dance floor.  END
BEGIN HERE “Looking back, everything was perfect,” says Julia. “From the rehearsal dinner at my parents’ yacht club to staying at the camp with my bridesmaids the night before the wedding, our celebration in Chilmark and a paella dinner on Sunday night before everyone left. It wasn’t just the wedding I’ll remember, but the whole experience.”  END

BEGIN HERE It's no surprise that men and women are wired differently when it comes to relationships and marriage, but it's not as different as we think. It's not that men do NOT want to get married, it's that they don't want to marry someone just because they are a certain age, nor are worried what others will say. END
BEGIN HERE Even in this day and age, most men feel it is their responsibility to provide for their family. It's an emotional burden that they choose — not because they are forced to, but because they want to, and all they expect in return is support and encouragement. END
BEGIN HERE Men are insecure, too. They are worried that they aren't making it in life — not just in the work force but also at home. Most men have not been raised to be vulnerable, so sometimes what they need is some positive assertion that's genuine and honest. All men want to feel appreciated. END

BEGIN HERE Talk about feeling the love! These bridesmaids just made their sister feel like a bonafide princess when they pulled off the most magical toast ever at her recent wedding.  END
BEGIN HERE Instead of delivering a traditional wedding toast when their sister's reception rolled around, her 'maids performed a medley of famous Disney songs, including The Lion King's "Can You Feel the Love Tonight," Beauty and the Beast's "Be Our Guest," Mulan's "I'll Make a Man Out of You," and "A Whole New World" from Aladdin. Not even a fairy godmother could serve up a speech this good! END
BEGIN HERE When Susie Kasteel wed her Prince Charming in Vancouver this past July, toast duties fell upon her two sisters, bridesmaids Sarah and Naomi Carter. So what are two Disney fanatics to do? Sing an entire musical's worth of Disney songs, with lyrics altered to perfectly fit the wedded couple's love story, of course!  END
BEGIN HERE "We sing all the time," Sarah explained to The Huffington Post. "Growing up, music was a big part of our household. As young girls we would sing along to all the Disney classics ― we know all the words! Naomi and I were also both very into musical theater." Oh, and the trio of sisters also regularly performs as the Disney princesses at children's birthday parties with their company, Crowned Princess Entertainment. Casual... END
BEGIN HERE So it should come as know surprise that these 'maids totally killed it on the big day. And the bride, of course couldn't help but agree. "Susie was smiling ear-to-ear during the performance, and we could tell she wanted to come up and join in," said the bride's sis. "You can hear her chiming in with background vocals during 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight.'" END
BEGIN HERE But a toast this good was bit a harder to pull off than just waving a magic wand. With Naomi residing overseas, the pair of 'maids had to plan most of the toast over email, before practicing in the car — on the day of!  END
BEGIN HERE "It was tough to keep it a secret from our sister, so our practice time and locations were limited," shared Naomi. "We used the hour between driving from the ceremony and the reception location to practice. We were glad that the performance itself was the best one we had done!"  END

BEGIN HERE The actor and father of (now!) two sat down with GQ recently and divulged his secrets of his blissful marriage to Blake Lively, which obviously includes his comical tips for dads-to-be when their wives are giving birth.  END
BEGIN HERE "Be in the room! You're not Don Draper. I think, be judicious with the photographs you take because, you know, a photo of your daughter crowning hanging on the refrigerator, that's not going to help anyone," he noted. "Your wife will never ever think it's funny if you tip your imaginary top hat and say, 'At your service!' — don't do that." Touché, touché. Although most ladies would agree that if Reynolds were at their service we'd probably allow him to play any imaginary game he wanted! END
BEGIN HERE The Deadpool star continued, "You really want to realize that you're the least important thing in the room. It's gonna go: Your wife, your baby, the nurse, the doctor, the doula — if you have one, the air — God, the air. And when your wife asks you if everything is okay down there, just answer in the affirmative. Don't yell, "Better than ever!" It's good to know you know your place. Blake, you're a lucky lady! END
BEGIN HERE The Canadian-born actor does speak from experience, to be fair. When it came to his first daughter's birth, he explained the scenario in a Conan interview about how it all went down, according to E! Online. "I was there in the delivery room. I mean, I was there for the conception of the child, so I thought the least I could do is be there in the delivery room. I'm not going to lie to you, I saw things. But, amazing!"  END
BEGIN HERE Even in the thick of the stress of labor and delivery, he said that Lively was a champion and total trooper. "At one point in the middle of the delivery, the doctor's cellphone went off and she said, 'Oh, no. Go ahead, take a personal call. Feel free.' She was cracking jokes in the delivery room," Reynolds said. "She may have been on drugs, but I don't ask personal questions."  END
BEGIN HERE Speaking of delivery rooms, the Canadian-born actor and his stunning 29-year-old wife just welcomed their second child into the world a few weeks ago, but have yet to announce the name of their little girl — staying true to their private ways. Earlier this month, however, Reynolds did let on that their new little one is another girl. The parents of two also have an almost two-year-old daughter, James. END

According to the 29-year-old mama of two, it's going to be pretty low-key. “Just cooking with family, cooking with cousins and little ones coming over, ya know,” she told People of her Thursday plans. “That’s about it, nothing too exciting.” Two babies and a hottie husband PLUS turkey?

BEGIN HERE Honestly could Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson get any cuter? The starlet couple has been married a total of 28 years — which in Hollywood standards is about 500 years, if we're being honest — and they still to this day give us so much to look forward to when it comes to marriage. On their 25th wedding anniversary, Tom Hanks even said, "I'm not one to suck up to the audience, but the only thing we ever argue about is who loves each other more." Like COME ON! Our hearts have never felt so mushy, except maybe after watching The Notebook, but that's a whole other story.  END
BEGIN HERE Now, for about the 15 millionth time in their relationship, these two are getting us all teary-eyed over the sanctity of marriage. But this time, it's Wilson who has our hearts melting. In a new music video, the song of which she created for My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2, the singer takes us through a series of emotional wedding photos as the song "Even More Mine" plays in the background. If that's not enough to get your tear ducts working overtime, Wilson even managed to add some of her own wedding photos into the mix, giving us that necessary Tomita(?) fix.  END
BEGIN HERE According to People, "Wilson co-wrote the tune — which is about a 'parent really letting go of their child, but also knowing that they're always there for them no matter what'— with Nathan Chapman and Darrell Brown." As a way to thank the Greek Wedding fans, a few months ago Wilson posted a call-out on Facebook for people to submit their wedding photos for a chance to be featured in her video. And as you can see, quite a few of them made it into the heartfelt vid.  END
BEGIN HERE "The fans really made the movies," Wilson told People. "I just thought it was a way to give back, in a sense. 'How could I thank you for your support? Well, maybe your picture will go into this video.' You can't really ever show your thanks one hundred percent, because you don't know everybody, but this was a small token of thanks for everything they've done for us." END

BEGIN HERE Full of glitz and glam, luxurious Monaco may be known as the playground for the rich and famous, but there’s more to it than prestige, wealth, and royalty. A honeymoon in Monaco would definitely make you first vacation as a married couple truly epic. If it’s within your honeymoon budget, this tiny principality (the second-smallest country in the world!) has much to offer a pair of lovesick newlyweds. Here's why you should totally consider a honeymoon in Monaco. END

Situated next to Italy, the country is also home to restaurants with Italian influences. Enjoy fresh fish or blue lobster, paired with stunning picturesque views, at Le Vistamar or experience elegant grandeur at Le Louis XV, helmed by top Monegasque chef Alain Ducasse and where all the clocks are stopped at 12 to remind you to savor the moment — something you’ll certainly want to do on your honeymoon. If you’re looking for something more casual, pop into Cooks Monaco, a hole-in-the-wall favorite among locals that serves fluffy squares of pizza. Whichever way you go, you’ve got it made. END
BEGIN HERE One of the biggest things to keep in mind when choosing your wedding reception venue is the size of your guest list. You want to strike the perfect balance between having enough room to keep everyone comfortable, but a small enough space that your guest list doesn’t feel too tiny for the square footage. When your guest list is at the higher end of the venue’s capacity, though, there’s always a chance things will feel a little squished. So how can you make it feel cozy, not crowded? We’ve got some expert tips that should come in handy. END
BEGIN HERE Creating a comfortable feeling at your wedding reception, as well as a great flow from one part of the evening to the next, is all about maximizing the floor plan. And who better to talk about creating the perfect floor plan than wedding planner to the stars and Wedding Paper Divas Style Partner Mindy Weiss? “As a general rule, never go over your venue’s capacity — for safety, legal, and aesthetic reasons,” says Weiss. “Instead of just looking at your venue’s maximum capacity, be sure to also ask how many guests can comfortably be seated in the space.” Still on the high end of the capacity? Follow these tips.  END
BEGIN HERE  The 4 Hard Truths of Wedding Planning END
BEGIN HERE What’s every wedding guest’s (and bride’s!) worst nightmare? A line at the bar! The best way to make sure no one’s left waiting for a drink is, of course, to hire more bartenders. But how many? And where should you put them? We turned to the pros to answer your bartending questions. END
BEGIN HERE Let’s start with the correct guest-to-bartender ratio. “For every 100 guests, I recommend at least one bar staffed by two bartenders to keep pesky lines down,” says Mindy Weiss, celebrity wedding planner and and Wedding Paper Divas Style Partner. So for a wedding with 150 guests, two bars and a minimum of three bartenders total is a good place to start, while 200 guests would require at least two bars with two bartenders at each.  END
BEGIN HERE “Pick the optimal placement for your bars based on your floor plan,” says Weiss. “Stick at least one bar away from the entrance so you don’t overcrowd the front of your venue, and be sure to position them away from the path to the kitchen.” A bar tucked on the far side of your venue is a great way to encourage guests all the way into the space once the doors open, while placing at least one close to the dance floor will let guests refuel without missing their favorite song.  END
BEGIN HERE “To mitigate the crowds at the bar even further, have waiters greet guests with trays of wine, champagne, and sparkling water,” Weiss suggests. This way they can grab a drink and head to their seats instead of making a pit-stop at the bar on their way. During the reception, consider having table-service for wine so you don’t have guests getting up for a refill during toasts, and have a few glasses pre-poured and set out on the bar so a guests who wants a glass of chardonnay doesn’t have to wait behind someone ordering a fancy cocktail.

BEGIN HERE  20 Ways to Throw the Best Wedding Ever END
BEGIN HERE When it comes to finding the one, timing is everything. Just ask Alexandra Tirsch and Zachary Pascal, who had their fair share of “missed connections” before getting together. They both attended Indiana University, but never met. Then, they were introduced at a mutual friend’s party in 2007, but were seeing other people. The two even made plans to hang out at a basketball game in Bloomington, but their plans just didn’t work out. So it wasn’t until 2008 when, out of all the bars in all the world, she walked into his…right as he was leaving! Even though their final connection was quick, it was still enough to do the trick. The very next day, Zach and Alexandra made plans for dinner and the rest, as they say, was history. END
BEGIN HERE While getting together took some time, choosing a venue did not. Envisioning a classic New York City wedding with a modern edge, Guastavino’s, a Manhattan event space with an exposed brick ballroom, immediately fit the bill. “We went to see it with my parents and loved it right away," says Alexandra. “We booked it on the spot.” The bride and groom knew they wanted a chic black and white color palette, infused with lots of greenery and candlelight, that would bring the space to life — and boy, were they right. As evidenced by Julian Ribinik’s gorgeous photos from the day, Alexandra and Zach made this New York City landmark all their own in spectacular fashion. END
BEGIN HERE "We wanted our wedding to feel like us, and to be classic with a modern edge," the bride says. Complete with granite arches, stone enclaves, and vaulted ceilings, Guastavino’s, nestled in a cozy spot beneath the Queensboro Bridge, was the perfect backdrop a celebration with a clean, modern aesthetic but with classic, romantic details. To set the vibe for their day, Alexandra and Zach chose black and white invitations with a modern calligraphy script.  END
BEGIN HERE As Executive Director of Jennifer Fisher jewelry, it’s no surprise that Alexandra had impeccable taste when it came to choosing a wedding dress. She wore a lace, tulle, and organza Elie Saab gown complete with an eye-catching cascade of floral appliques. “I knew I wanted something with a skirt before I even started looking for a dress," says the bride. "I feel strongly that this is the one day you can wear something like that in your life, so you might as well do it!" And since Elie Saab is her favorite evening wear designer, the bride knew she could expect impeccable attention to detail. She customized the already incredible silhouette with removable leather straps and a leather belt. "It was very out of the box for me and I am happy I went for it." END
BEGIN HERE Alexandra accessorized with a pair of blue Jimmy Choo shoes, and, of course, a selection of jewelry from Jennifer Fisher, including diamond initial stud earrings to reflect both her and her soon-to-be husband’s names. END
BEGIN HERE For his tuxedo, Zach donned a grosgrain jacket and Burberry tuxedo pants along with a custom bowtie. END
BEGIN HERE Confident in their fashionable friends, the bride and groom asked both the men and women of their wedding party to choose their own outfits for the day. The bridesmaids’ black gowns paired nicely with chic Calla Lily bouquets, while the groomsmen’s tuxedos were classic and uncomplicated — a look polished off by personalized pocket squares from the groom.   END
BEGIN HERE Throughout the planning process, Alexandra knew what she wanted, and the process of designing the chuppah with her florist was no different.  While some questioned her decision to skip flowers during this important part of the day, the bride stayed true to her intuition. “My florist was amazing and really let me have my vision here,” she says. “She asked me, 'Are you sure you don't want flowers?' But I just knew I didn’t want them. My dress had so many floral details, so I wanted the chuppah to be simple and different.” And so, a lucite chuppah topped with lush greenery and ferns made for a gorgeously modern space under which the couple exchanged vows with the guidance of both a priest and rabbi. END
BEGIN HERE Alexandra walked down the candle-lined aisle with both her mother and father. "We lined the aisle with large circular vases with candles and had them surrounding the chuppah and edges of the room," says the bride. "Candlelight was important to me. I think it evokes a special mood and makes the space feel intimate."  END
BEGIN HERE The pair decided not to write their own vows but invited two close friends to share meaningful readings during the ceremony. Once Alexandra and Zach were pronounced husband and wife, they made their exit to an acoustic version of Katy Perry's "Firework." END
BEGIN HERE Guests found their seating assignments on a table laden with white orchids, the bride's favorite flower, and lilies. The sleek black cards were a nod to the couple's invitation envelope. END
BEGIN HERE The newlyweds took advantage of the the reception's sky-high ceilings and chose to decorate tables with alternating arrangements of tall green branches and smaller clusters of anemones, peeled roses, fringed tulips, and orchids. Black menus with white calligraphy stood out against against the crisp white linens. And, to make sure the room was filled with plenty of warm candlelight, tables of all shapes and sizes were adorned with elegant lucite candelabras. END
BEGIN HERE The cake was inspired by a design that made its way into many of the day’s festivities — from envelope liners to pillows at the cocktail hour. Done in a smooth white fondant with hand-painted black strokes all around it, this four-tiered cake was designed to mimic one of the bride’s favorite patterns: “Channels” by Kelly Wearstler. Topped with fresh peeled roses, it was almost to pretty to eat. That is, until you learned it was filled with alternating layers of red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting and chocolate cake with vanilla mascarpone filling. END
BEGIN HERE   Instead of fretting over décor that only lasts a night, the couple had a truly bright idea for a unique keepsake. “I wanted something fun to hang over the upstairs reception bar that sits under a stone cave and decided to do a neon sign," Alexandra says. “It read, ‘Your love is bright as ever’ which is a lyric from our first dance song, 'XO' by Beyonce. It was definitely a challenge getting this done, but we loved it and now it hangs like art in our apartment."  END
BEGIN HERE When there’s a disco ball and a checkered dance floor at your wedding, you clearly know how to throw a party, and this couple did not disappoint. Thanks to a flawless playlist curated by the groom, and a lively rendition of “Sweet Home Indiana” from the Brooklyn Sound Band, Alexandra and Zach led their guests through a fun-filled night. END
BEGIN HERE "The most important thing for us was for everyone to eat great food, drink and have a great time," the bride says. "I think we definitely accomplished that. We wanted this to feel like a great party and reflect us as a couple in that sense. It was inviting, warm, and most importantly, fun. In the end, all the small details you stress over no one really remembers, but they do remember how you made them feel!" By the looks of this packed dance floor, we'd say the couple's guests felt entirely welcome. END
BEGIN HERE As for advice for brides-to-be, Alexandra has this to say: “Do not sweat the small stuff. There are lots of ups and downs that come with planning your wedding and it is easy to get caught up in every last minuscule detail. I panicked over a lot of smaller details, like cocktail napkin designs, and linens, and I am sure no one even noticed or remembers them. As my father reminded me throughout, your guests are going to remember great food and great music, not much else!" END

BEGIN HERE Whether you’re dragging your feet on hiring a DJ or stalling on writing your wedding vows, procrastination strikes even the most motivated of brides. Unfortunately, unlike that work presentation that you threw together last minute and absolutely nailed, delaying wedding planning can have some seriously annoying side effects. END
BEGIN HERE Lisa Criscera, founder and co-owner of wedding and event planning company L.C. Solutions LLC, says that most brides “biggest mistake is they think they have more time than they actually do.” So even if you have months (or even a year!) before you get hitched, time may just sneak up on you. END
BEGIN HERE    One major way to fight dragging your feet on getting things done is by divvying up the work. Whether that means getting your significant other involved (ahem—you both are the ones getting married, after all!), or hiring a wedding planner who can help keep you on track, don’t leave it all on your shoulders. “Do not try and do everything yourself,” Criscera says. She adds, “Absolutely make a schedule for yourself that’s tailored to [your wedding] specifically.” That means, not letting yourself get overwhelmed by super-detailed ones you find online, or just picking a random one that doesn’t take into account your timeline or wedding’s specific quirks. END
BEGIN HERE She also recommends consulting other brides you know who have recently gotten married about their experiences with vendors and the planning process—some of their suggestions may help steer you in the right direction with less effort. Work smarter, not harder, we say! END
BEGIN HERE We all know that most eyes will be on you during your big day, but that doesn’t mean you don’t want to give your guests something else gorgeous to look at!

BEGIN HERE Florescio Films captured every classic moment of this couple's glamorous celebration — from the décor inside the Curtis Center, Stephanie and Mike's incredible Philly venue, right down to the details on the bride's beautiful Vera Wang wedding dress. We love how this couple embraced a totally glam vibe for their day, starting with the bride's and bridesmaids' attire. Stephanie donned an unforgettable strapless ballgown and accessorized with jeweled Jimmy Choo pumps. Her bridesmaids all donned floor-length purple gowns, a hue that the bride and groom carried over to the rest of their day, starting with Stephanie's bouquet. END
BEGIN HERE Dan + Abby! Dan Smyers, one half of the country music group Dan + Shay, is officially engaged after popping the question to his girlfriend, Abby Law. And leave it to a country crooner to pull off an ultra-romantic proposal — on a beautiful Hawaiian beach, no less! Here are all of the popped question deets... END
BEGIN HERE It turns out that marriage has been on Smyers' mind since his music partner, Shay Mooney, proposed to his girlfriend back in August. "I'll get on it soon enough!" Smyers previously told People magazine. And he certainly did! Now, both halves of the country duo are toting #engaged status. Think they'll take over wedding singer duties at each other's nuptials? END
BEGIN HERE According to People, Smyers popped the question to his longtime love on Waikiki Beach while the pair was vacationing in Hawaii earlier this week. The bride-to-be spilled the nuptial news on her Instagram page on Friday, posting a photo (see below) of her and her new fiancé sharing a smooch on the beach. "There are few words to fully convey this feeling of complete happiness," Law captioned the sweet snapshot. "Daniel Smyers, knowing and loving you has been the most rewarding part of my life thus far and continuing our journey together as your wife will be an honor. I love you so much my heart could explode!!! Y'all WE'RE ENGAGED!!!!!" END
BEGIN HERE Smyers also took to social media to celebrate, posting a photo of him and his bride — with Law's new engagement ring in full view! "We're gonna save all the animals together, FOREVER," he wrote. END

BEGIN HERE Later, Law couldn't help but post yet another engagement selfie. (Could you blame the girl?) "The amount of love we have been shown already today is humbling and overwhelming in the best possible way," she captioned the snapshot of her and Smyers toasting their engagement. "We are incredibly lucky to be surrounded by such exceptional people. We love y'all so much. Now I'm going to go drink more champagne with my fiancé." END
BEGIN HERE Congrats, you two! END
BEGIN HERE Even if you can't have the tropical destination wedding of your dreams, you can certainly choose a wedding color palette and style that transport your guests to the sexy, sweltering island of Bali!   END
BEGIN HERE Perfect for a summer wedding, this bright and cheerful color scheme is not for the faint of heart (no abundance of pastels here!), and we hope your fiancé isn't afraid of a little pink, because there will be no shortage of it!  Choose a range of pinks, from something hot, poppy and bright à la this amazing Milly ensemble (perfect for your honeymoon!), to a pink that is slightly more muted, and temper it with whites and pops of a mango/peachy tone and gold accents.   END
BEGIN HERE Don't go too overtly tropical with your flowers, (no birds of paradise, please!), but a pretty orchid here and there give just the subtle nod you need. Choose a variety that is all white with a brightly colored center.  For paper goods, we love this Ikat inspired invitation from Paperless Post — a modern design and font with just the right amount of color. If you're so lucky as to be able to look for a venue that echoes the Balinese feel you're going for, look for something with lots of teak wood details and floaty white curtains. For your reception décor, these little gold lotus tea lights would look perfect on a dark wood rectangular table, clustered among a runner of brightly colored loose flowers.   END

BEGIN HERE It's only natural for friends to go through life milestones at the same time — snagging your first real apartment, figuring out what your 401(k) options are, or finally getting your own Netflix account rather than mooching off your parents'. So it stands to reason that all the weddings in a friend group all seem to happen within a short time frame - opening the door for a lot of sharing about the planning process. But what happens when one of your fellow brides-to-be has a wedding budget that's eight times the size of yours? Or what if she's opted to schedule her wedding two weeks before yours and snagged the exact food truck vendor you wanted? You may be dealing with an unwelcome emotion - envy. Read ahead for how to deal if you're feeling a pang of wedding-related jealousy with one of your pals.  END
BEGIN HERE    If someone is envious of you - and come on, your style is on point, so it's bound to happen - Leahy suggests recognizing several things. First, he recommends "normalizing that envy is a universal emotion." Everyone has been there. Leahy also says it crucial to recognize that people are envious because they believe that you have something very positive (and you have nothing to feel guilty about), and adds that you shouldn't take it personally. He also says that to undercut the tension you can compliment the person who is envious of you "since this will help them feel less humiliated" and "realize that envy is part of friendships, along with many positive emotions - such as respect and love." No, it's not easy being green, but that doesn't mean it's the death knell of a friendship. "I would suggest that you make room for envy along with all of those other emotions," Leahy says. END
BEGIN HERE Amongst the chaos of wedding planning, it's easy to forget about some of the smaller details leading up to the big day. But with the rehearsal dinner being a special time where you can relax with your closest family and friends before the big day, it's important to choose the perfect place. Here are some of our favorite northern New Jersey spots to host your guests as you kick off your wedding weekend.  END
BEGIN HERE Whether it's your first marriage, second marriage or more, it’s still a moment to celebrate. And you should celebrate it with a wedding, of course! If it’s not your first time walking down the aisle, you might be inclined to shake things up — or even feel like a traditional wedding isn’t the way to go. Not sure where to start? Our experts have a few ideas you might want to consider! END
BEGIN HERE The most important thing to remember is that it’s your wedding. If you want to stick to tradition, from wearing something blue to having your dad walk you down the aisle to cutting a cake, go for it! Create a celebration that’s worthy of your love and commitment, no matter if you’ve been down the aisle before.  END
BEGIN HERE That being said, there are a lot of ways to personalize and update your second marriage wedding plans to reflect the stage you’re at in your life. Here are a few ideas: END
BEGIN HERE There’s no rule against having a registry for your second wedding. However, you may want to go a non-traditional route (especially if your home is fully stocked!). Look into a honeymoon registry (or a family-moon if you plan on taking your kids with you) or a home improvement fund instead of traditional china and cookware. Or consider a charitable registry, where guests can make gifts to a cause you love. END
BEGIN HERE While San Francisco has a reputation as a bohemian city, its rich history and abundance of historic buildings also means that the city knows a thing or two about glamour and sophistication. These Bay Area wedding venues are the perfect options for a wedding that puts the emphasis on elegance. END
BEGIN HERE It seems like only yesterday that Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi, Jennifer "JWoww" Farley, and Deena Cortese were partying it up on The Jersey Shore. But since retiring their Ed Hardy hats and itty bitty micro dresses, the former MTV stars have been busy getting hitched and having babies. Almost two years ago, Polizzi wed her sweetheart, Jionni LaValle. Then in October of last year, Farley tied the knot with Roger Mathews. And now, Deena Cortese just claimed her spot as the next Jersey Shore alum to walk down the aisle. Cortese just announced that she's engaged to her longtime love Christopher Buckner — and her super stunning engagement ring is definitely worth fist pumping over... END
BEGIN HERE According to Entertainment Tonight, the MTV star's sweetheart whisked her away for a surprise getaway to celebrate their fifth anniversary. "When you think you're just going away for a night for your 5 year anniversary then find out your boyfriend made sure you have off from work but tells your friends at work to make it look like you're still on the schedule then he surprises you with a weekend getaway! Whatttt.. I can't believe he pulled this off," Cortese posted to Instagram on Friday.  END
BEGIN HERE But an impromptu vacay wasn't the only surprise Buckner had up his sleeve! While walking on a beach during their Mexico vacation, Buckner romantically popped the question — with a truly gorgeous round-cut diamond engagement ring, no less!  END
BEGIN HERE "I always knew I would spend the rest of my life with Christopher," Cortese wrote on Instagram, captioning a collage of photos of the night she officially became a bride-to-be. "But last night while we were walking on the Beach in Mexico he made it official!! We're engaged!!!!!" END
BEGIN HERE A few hours later, Cortese couldn't help but show off her ring again on the 'Gram, in a slew of close-up photos of her bling with its trendy split-shank band and huge center stone. "I felt like the other pictures didn't show how beautiful the ring was," she wrote. "The pic on the left was me a little after he proposed after I was finished happy sobbing lol Christopher did such an amazing job picking me out the perfect ring. It fits my little hand perfectly. This still all doesn't feel real!!!" END
BEGIN HERE  Snooki Calls BFF JWoww a "Bridezilla!" END
BEGIN HERE And then on Sunday, the bride-to-be posted one final poolside photo to social media, summing up her picture-perfect proposal weekend with a lengthy, too-cute caption. "I can't believe this is all real," Cortese wrote. "This year has been really hard for me and my mom. I honestly haven't felt 100% happy since my dad passed away ..until this weekend... I'm glad we are able to end the year with a happy moment. I know my dad had a front row seat when Chris proposed and I know he's looking down with a smile from ear to ear. I love you Chris and love that you brought me to this beautiful place for our anniversary/engagement weekend." Aww! END
BEGIN HERE Think Cortese's former co-stars Snooki and JWoww will score bridesmaid status at her upcoming wedding? They'll definitely get the party started at the reception, after all! END
BEGIN HERE 'Tis the time of year to show thanks. And one person you must thank is your spouse. Why? Because according to psychotherapist and relationship expert Toni Coleman, “too often, when partners give feedback to one another it is about what is not going well in the relationship. The focus is on the negative — what their partner has said or done or not said or done that has hurt, disappointed, or angered them. And they seem to take the good things for granted and assume the other knows they are valued and appreciated.”  END
BEGIN HERE On the flip side, “when we take the time to show gratitude, it lets our partners know that their efforts have not gone unnoticed,” says Lesli Doares, marriage coach and author of Blueprint For a Lasting Marriage. “It lets them know that they are important to us and that our lives are better for them being part of it.”  END
BEGIN HERE So to get you started on spreading your gratitude, here are eight things our experts say you should thank your spouse for this season — and every season after it.  END
BEGIN HERE    One of the best things about being in a relationship with someone who has his own interests is that you often get to try something new, just by virtue of being together. “When you go along with something they like that you might not have thought to try, they are helping you grow by experiencing new things,” Doares says. “You may love the activity or you may hate it, but either way you will have changed,” and that is something to be thankful for.

BEGIN HERE Mark Sheppard just tied the knot and his sunset, floral-filled wedding was so darn gorgeous, it was practically — dare we say — supernatural. (Sorry, we had to.) Over the weekend, The Supernatural actor wed his sweetheart, Sarah Louise Fudge in Malibu, California and we have all the wedding day details — including the star-stuffed guest list. END
BEGIN HERE According to E! News, Sheppard proposed back in August of 2015, with the couple announcing it on social media via a stunning (http://www.brides.com/story/unique-ceremony-structures) covered in white blooms. "And it was a bloody great one! Thank you to everyone who made it so fantastic & thank you to @realmarksheppard for being the love of my life." END
BEGIN HERE After the "I dos" were said, wedding guests — including Supernatural's Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles, and Alaina Huffman — snapped some pics on the venue's gorgeous grounds with a stunning sunset in the background. And then post-party, Sheppard and his bride basked in that domestic bliss. "Long day.... I love my wife," Sheppard captioned an Instagram snapshot of his love washing the dishes — while still wearing her wedding dress!  END

BEGIN HERE Joe Biden, possibly America's most eligible (and HOT, trust us) bachelor back in his prime, just revealed to Vogue the love story behind his and his wife Dr. Jill Biden's impressive 39-year marriage.  END
BEGIN HERE The Vice President was actually married before his walk down the aisle with Jill, to his high school sweetheart Neilia Biden. But shortly after he was elected as senator of Delaware, he received some devastating news. His wife and their three kids — Naomi, Beau, and Hunter — had gone on a Christmas shopping trip when a tractor-trailer struck their car and killed both Naomi and Neilia in the wreckage. As difficult as this was to overcome, the politician did everything in his power to raise his two kids, Beau and Hunter, to the best of his ability.  END
BEGIN HERE Then, three years after his wife and daughter had been killed in that tragic accident, he met Jill. According to Vogue, Joe's brother introduced the two, and Joe has recently claimed that he thinks their meeting was a gift from Neilia. On their first date, Jill — who was divorced and going to college at the time — admitted she didn't think the two would mesh well.  END
BEGIN HERE "I was a senior, and I had been dating guys in jeans and clogs and T-shirts, he came to the door and he had a sport coat and loafers, and I thought, 'God, this is never going to work, not in a million years.' He was nine years older than I am!" Jill confessed. "But we went out to see A Man and a Woman at the movie theater in Philadelphia, and we really hit it off. When we came home...he shook my hand good night...I went upstairs and called my mother at 1:00am and said, 'Mom, I finally met a gentleman.'" END
BEGIN HERE D'awww! END
BEGIN HERE But even though she had met her gentleman, she wasn't so sure she wanted to hop on the marriage train just yet. It took Joe legitimately FIVE times before his sweetheart would accept his proposal. According to Jill though, it was for good reason.  END
BEGIN HERE "I said, 'Not yet. Not yet. Not yet.' Because by that time, of course, I had fallen in love with the boys [Beau and Hunter], and I really felt that this marriage had to work. Because they had lost their mom, and I couldn't have them lose another mother. So I had to be 100 percent sure."  END
BEGIN HERE Still, Joe was getting impatient. Finally on the fifth time of asking for her hand in marriage, he gave her the ultimatum. "Look, this is the last time I'm asking you. I don't care when we get married. But I want a commitment," he told Vogue of that fateful day. "And she said okay. But it took that!" END

BEGIN HERE A bride that enters the fray on Black Friday to find herself the dress of her dreams is the kind of emboldened woman you do not want to mess with. She is fierce, she is focused, and she will let nothing stand in between that her and that gorgeous gown being sold at a majorly discounted price. Sound like you? Then you've come to the right place. Here are some must-know tips from bridal retail experts to make sure your Black Friday bridal shopping experience goes swiftly.   END
BEGIN HERE  This Is the Most Pinned Wedding Dress on Pinterest END
BEGIN HERE The topic of alterations will surely come up while you're trying on dresses. Ask your sales associate to be very clear with you about what is feasible, and approximately how much each alteration will cost. END
BEGIN HERE "Some dresses can have small modifications, but be careful in purchasing a dress based on price only with the expectation of making major changes. That can be costly, and not beneficial to saving money," warns Sheldon. "Even seemingly simple changes can be difficult when it comes to the delicate construction of a wedding gown."  END
BEGIN HERE Make sure you give yourself enough time to have these alterations done. If you don't have much time between Black Friday and your wedding date, Sheldon says to buy a dress that's a near-perfect fit off the rack. Of course, if you have a good four to six months between, you should be good to go.  END
BEGIN HERE While we're on the subject, don't forget that Black Friday is a great time to shop for your honeymoon and other wedding accessories. Hit up the lingerie store, shoe shop, and cosmetic counter to find steals. END
BEGIN HERE They've said their vows, kissed their first kiss, and danced their first dance — and it's that last one we're most excited about considering the bride's killer moves! Dancing with the Stars pro Kym Johnson and Shark Tank star Robert Herjavec are officially married, having tied the knot over the weekend in a gorgeous Beverly Hills wedding. And from Johnson's to-die-for wedding dress to their first dance song, we've got all of the couple's big day details. Just trust us on this: Their serious ballroom skills are going to make you want to force your hubby-to-be to take pre-wedding dancing lessons! END
BEGIN HERE After appearing together on season 20 of Dancing with the Stars (Johnson ended up being Herjavec's pro partner!), the reality TV pair fell madly in love. And while they may sashayed away from the ABC hit without the infamous disco ball trophy, we think the dazzling diamond engagement ring Johnson made off with was a pretty nice consolation prize! After a short, five-month engagement, the pirouetting pair finally tied the knot Sunday evening at the Fours Seasons in Beverly Hills, California, according to People magazine. END
BEGIN HERE Johnson previously teased us with a wedding dress design that she promised to be far simpler than the glittery, glitzy minidresses she normally performs in, and her gorgeous gown definitely didn't disappoint. The bride stunned in a strapless Monique Lhuillier ballgown, free of any sparkly embellishment for a look that was clean and classic, but made modern with voluminous tiered skirt. Johnson walked down the aisle with both of her parents in tow and clutching a bouquet of white blooms as "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" played in the background. "I hope I can speak and that I'm not sobbing with happiness," the bride said ahead of the big day. "I'm sure I'll be overcome with emotion." END
BEGIN HERE Meanwhile, we were overcome with emotion when we heard about the newlyweds' first dance (see below) — particularly a feeling that made us want to get up and groove! Johnson and Herjavec actually performed not one, but two dances for their guests (who included DWTS alum Joey Fatone, Lance Bass, and Donny Osmond!). END
BEGIN HERE According to Us Weekly, their first first dance was to Etta James' "At Last," with the couple doing a classic waltz to the ultra-romantic number. Then, the pair's bridal party also hit the dance floor to join the couple in a group dance to LunchMoney Lewis' "Bills" — a song that's particularly special to the newlyweds. The 2015 hit was actually the first song Herjavec and Johnson ever danced together back during their DWTS days. END

BEGIN HERE As sweet as it is having your bestie ask you to stand beside her on her big day, any bridesmaid knows that with that title comes a depleted bank account, energy level, and free time. Being a bridesmaid is hard work, y'all — even if you're a celeb! Celebrities like Lena Dunham, Beyoncé, Lauren Conrad, and Taylor Swift have all stepped out of the spotlight, exchanged their red carpet gowns for bridesmaid dresses, and spent a day (or two) fluffing their BFF's train. Stars — they're just like us, amiright? And just like us normies, celebs are also susceptible to bridesmaid burnout. The latest victim of the affliction? Jennifer Lawrence, who recently got real about why she'll never be a bridesmaid again.  END
BEGIN HERE J. Law may be a dream bridesmaid to tons of fans (she may trip down the aisle, but she'll keep you laughing and stress-free throughout the day!), but it looks like Lawrence will be rejecting bridal party invites from now on. So far, the Passengers actress has been recruited four times (!) for bridesmaid duty and she's capping it at that. "All of my friends are getting married and having babies," the star said in her recent Vanity Fair cover story. "Weddings rock, but I will never be a bridesmaid again." She looked so perfect in that pastel yellow J.Crew bridesmaid dress (see photo below) at her brother's 2014 wedding, though! But alas, nothing is going to get this girl back in a chiffon bridal party frock. END
BEGIN HERE "There needs to be a bridesmaids' union," Lawrence continued. (We must admit, that's not the worst idea, J. Law...) "It's horrendous. If anyone asks me again, I'm going to say, 'No. That part of my life is over. I appreciate the ask.'" END
BEGIN HERE The actress is taking such a strong stance on the bridesmaid issue that she doesn't even want to ask her own besties to suffer the status. "If I do ever get married," she mused. "I don't think I will have bridesmaids. How can I rank my friends?" Any bride with a slew of BFFs can certainly relate... END
BEGIN HERE  37 Times Celebrities Were Bridesmaids END

BEGIN HERE While the two of you are the most important people at a wedding, half the fun is being able to celebrate and anticipate your big day with your closest friends by your side serving as bridesmaids and groomsmen. While you might think you can just grab your friends, assign them a bridal title, and call it a day, there are a few other things you’ll want to consider before you assemble your wedding party. Our experts have five key tips that will help you choose your bridesmaids and groomsmen — and make sure your wedding party is one for the ages! END
BEGIN HERE Sometimes, having fewer bridesmaids or groomsmen is the easiest way to make sure no one’s feelings are hurt. If your choice is between having just your sister and your childhood BFF stand beside you or expanding into two or three friend groups and ten or more ‘maids, the smaller group could save you a lot of stress versus deciding who does and doesn’t make the cut. On the other hand, if you’re committed to the idea of a huge wedding party, and there’s one friend on the fringe, you might be better off including one more than leaving them out. END
BEGIN HERE Some people absolutely love spending time together in a large group, as a family. But not everybody grew up that way, or feels comfortable staying in the midst of a chaotic zoo of a family they recently married into, over the holidays.  END
BEGIN HERE Regardless of which camp you fall into, there's an important reality for recently wed couples to except: The first few holiday visits after you get married can be extremely stressful for a newlywed couple. END
BEGIN HERE Newlyweds who haven't spent a lot of time vacationing with both families often find themselves staring down the barrel of an awkward situation during their first married holiday season. You have to figure out a way to split time so both families get time with you on different important holidays, without hurting anybody's feelings. At the same time, you want to have a happy visit together that will set the tone for many, many future holidays and important occasions. END
BEGIN HERE There are five things you can plan ahead for that will make your holiday stay (or visit) with your in-laws much more successful: END
BEGIN HERE    Be sure to bring a lovely hostess gift for your new in-laws, and give it to them as soon as you've arrived. It doesn't have to be something fancy or expensive — if you bake or craft, homemade is frequently more appreciated by your new extended family. If you're staying with your in-laws during the visit, be sure to strip and remake your bed before you leave. Offer to put fresh sheets on it, and if your mother-in-law tells you not to worry, make up the bed without the sheets so it looks good from the doorway. Take all your used bath towels to the laundry room, and empty wastebaskets in the bedroom and bathroom before you go. You're not a houseguest — you're part of the family now. Make the best impression by not leaving any more work for the hosts than is absolutely necessary. And make sure you handwrite and mail a thank-you note as soon as you get back home. END
BEGIN HERE After 16 years together, Michelle Rabkin and Paul Pinto imagined they’d get married in a small city-hall ceremony followed by a big party at home. Instead, they did just the opposite, tying the knot at the bride’s family home in Piedmont, California, and then heading into San Francisco for a formal reception in the massive rotunda of its historic City Hall. “It was reverse logic,” says Michelle. “We love what the building stands for and that it’s beautiful in and of itself, but we wouldn’t have been able to turn the space around quickly enough between the ceremony and reception.” END
BEGIN HERE On October 3, 2015, Michelle and Paul welcomed 155 guests to a flower-filled ceremony and a downtown reception, complete with botanical details inspired by the Rabkin family home. “We knew we wanted to get married outdoors immersed in greenery, somewhere beautiful, and somewhere that had meaning to us,” the bride says. With the help of Laurie Arons Special Events and florist Sarah Winward, the couple pulled off one seriously spectacular day at two equally special venues, all tied together with a botanical theme. Read on to see every perfect detail, as captured by Jose Villa.  END
BEGIN HERE The bride’s sister and maid of honor, Beth, just so happens to be an accomplished designer, so it was an easy decision for Michelle and Paul to lean on her expertise for their invitation suite. She started with the couple’s save-the-date, which was modeled after old botanical print in their childhood home and a magnolia, Michelle’s favorite flower. That aesthetic ultimately carried over to the rest of the couple’s wedding. “It was really important to me that the whole wedding felt botanical,” the bride says. “I grew up loving the outdoors. I love being outside. I kept saying I wanted it to be wild, lush, and green when we were planning.” END
BEGIN HERE How gorgeous was Michelle’s ivory silk Oscar de la Renta wedding dress? “I liked that this dress was timeless and modern, structured and feminine, and unique but simple all in one,” she says. “It felt bridal and beautiful but wouldn’t scream to be the center of attention, which was a balance I really liked.”  The strapless silhouette fit her like a glove, and her flowing veil, wedding-appropriate lace heels, and a bold red lip lent a glamorous vibe to her look.     END
BEGIN HERE For her final touch, Michelle wore her mother’s pearl earrings and carried her grandmother’s lace handkerchief. In keeping with the flower-focused vibe of the day, the bride’s bouquet was packed with an abundance of gorgeous blooms in shades of green, white, and burgundy. The wild, garden-like mix was comprised of antique and koko loko garden roses, anemones, nandina, and greenery, all tied together with hand-dyed ribbons.  END
BEGIN HERE Paul’s boutonniere, the finishing touch for his Tom Ford tuxedo, was made from astrantia and fragrant jasmine vine.  END
BEGIN HERE While the bride went neutral with her look, she wasn’t afraid to bring in color in the form of her bridesmaids’ dresses and bouquets. Michelle’s five ‘maids wore gray chiffon gowns from Joanna August and carried bright bouquets, complete with pink garden roses and astilbe.  END
BEGIN HERE Even the couple’s youngest attendants donned garden-inspired hues. Flower girls in pink dresses wore hydrangea crowns while Michelle and Paul’s four ring bearers looks super sweet in their striped bow ties.  END
BEGIN HERE One of the couple’s biggest pre-wedding challenges was figuring out where exactly their ceremony would take place. In the end, the best way to accommodate the couple’s full guest list was to cover the family’s pool with a platform, a task that Laurie Arons and Mr. Rabkin took on as a team. “They’re two of the most detail-oriented people on the face of the earth,” Michelle says. “It was a logistical nightmare, but they pulled it off!”  END
BEGIN HERE In keeping with their vision of a botanical celebration, the couple turned to florist Sarah Winward to create a chuppah decked out tons of different flowers. “We didn’t want it to look overly manicured. Having different textures and a little bit of wildness was very important to me,” Michelle says. “That’s actually why we picked Sarah. I had to have her!” Rows of wooden chairs faced the stunning structure, which was made from lush layers of magnolia branches, smilax, oak-leaf hydrangeas, and snow berries and designed to look as if it had been growing naturally in the space. Urns overflowing with the same mix, plus tons of café au lait dahlias, were arranged along the aisle.  END
BEGIN HERE The 5 p.m. ceremony was officiated by both a priest and a rabbi, a decision that was important to the couple. “We wanted an interfaith ceremony that incorporated both Jewish and Catholic religions,” Michelle says. In addition to reciting their own vows, the bride and groom asked four friends to share meaningful readings and tapped their immediate family members to read the seven traditional Jewish wedding blessings.  END
BEGIN HERE After the ceremony, guests were shuttled into downtown San Francisco, where they were treated to a champagne toast on the mayor’s balcony at City Hall. There, everyone found an escort card display they won’t soon forget: Sarah Winward created framed pressed botanicals, which were finished with guests names and table assignments, all handwritten by the couple’s calligrapher. “We were trying to think of the right way to bring in botanicals for the reception,” says the bride. “I love plants and textures but the pressed plants were sort of a great allusion to the botanical print on our invitation that started the whole conversation. It wasn’t overly theme-y, but I do think they were a more literal representation of our wedding inspiration.” END
BEGIN HERE The couple loved the Beaux-arts architecture of City Hall, so they worked with Laurie and Sarah to create wild, lush floral details that would strike a balance between their outdoor ceremony and indoor reception. For them, that meant filling the Rotunda with tall trees in beautiful pots, a mix of different plants, and mismatched centerpieces. “It was so cool to walk through the space and see oak leaves casting shadows on the walls,” the bride says. “It added something.

"You'll also build more lean tissue which you want because it will not only change your shape and make you look more defined, it also drives metabolism, so you'll burn calories at a faster rate all day, every day."

Copeland donned a wedding dress by designer Inbal Dror — who is known for sexy, of-the-moment designs — and Christian Louboutin shoes.

BEGIN HERE Congratulations are in order for The Young and the Restless costars Justin Hartley and Chrishell Stause! The actors announced that they are getting married, sharing the happy engagement news on Instagram over the weekend. And, spoiler, her engagement ring is just plain gorgeous. END
BEGIN HERE After first confirming they were dating back in January 2014, Hartley, 39, and his 35-year-old costar Stause (née Terrina Chrishell Stause) have shared that they are taking their relationship to a new level, according to Just Jared. In true ring selfie-loving fashion, the soap opera star and bride-to-be took to social media to announce her exciting news. END
BEGIN HERE "You guys think I need sunscreen..?... @justinhartley" she posted on Instagram, which was quickly followed by some emoji necessities when announcing your engagement — a diamond ring and heart eyes. The former All My Children actress then tweeted, "Such a happy time. Thanks for all the well wishes guys! So sweet," after receiving excited fan replies regarding the announcement. END
BEGIN HERE In the photo, her ring is on display front-and-center while she appears to be lounging on the beach, and it's clear her hubby-to-be did some MAJ diamond research as it is quite the stunner! The new forever bling boasts a sparkly emerald-cut diamond with a pave band, and Stause was rocking light pink manicure with glittery nail tips. It's unclear if Stausel already had her nails ready to go pre-proposal or if she got a fresh mani to show off her engagement ring, but either way, we need sunglasses for that rock. END
BEGIN HERE The newly engaged TV stars both have lengthy resumes when it comes to their acting careers. Hartley has starred in quite the lineup of television shows, including Passions, Revenge, and Smallville. This fall, he'll be featured in NBC's much-awaited This is Us series about relationships and love, reports CBS8. His wife-to-be has also graced the small screen in numerous soap operas — All My Children  Days of Our Lives, and The Young and the Restless being the most recent (she joined the cast in May 2016). END
BEGIN HERE For Hartley, this will be a second marriage. The actor was previously married to his Passions co-star Lindsay Korman from 2004 to 2012 with whom he has a 12-year-old daughter. While it's unclear if his ex approves of Hartley's new love, his bride-to-be shared an interesting tidbit about her only run-in with his ex-wife. "My very first job ever, I was an extra on Passions for one day and it was a scene where [Lindsay's] now husband [Justin] and another guy were fighting over her," Chrishell said in an interview a few years ago, Just Jared dished in 2014. "I was slow dancing in the background, so technically I haven't met her, but I have shared spaced with her." Slightly awkward, but we're hoping that everyone is as happy for the newly-engaged couple as we are. Congrats, you two; see below for photos of Stause's stunning bling. END

BEGIN HERE The bridal runways have been a bit of a fiesta as of late, as they've been positively teeming with a whole new slew of wedding dresses toting a stunning Spanish influence. ¿Por qué? you ask. Well, because the style is simply gorgeous, that's why! Since the Fall 2016 bridal lines descended upon the runways a year ago, designers have been looking to Spain for inspiration and the too-die-for result is gowns with the added dimension of fantastic fringe, gotta-touch-it texture, and endless sex appeal. ¿Muy caliente, no?

BEGIN HERE Attention Duggar family super fans! If you just so happened to drop a wedding invitation in the mailbox (or inbox) of TLC's most famous family, it looks like you're going to have an extra 19 seats at your reception. The Duggars are checking 'no' on those RSVP cards, according to an email response fans are receiving from the former 19 Kids and Counting clan. The least they could do is send a gift, right? Miss Manners would so not approve... END
BEGIN HERE Nineteen extra reception meal plates sure ain't cheap, so we were super surprised to learn that brides-to-be were extending wedding invites to the stars of TLC's Counting On. (But to each their own, right?) However, these to-be wedded couples in question probably won't be seeing any famous faces amongst their wedding guests come the big day. According to International Business Times, Duggar devotees who have emailed the Counting On fan mail account have been receiving an automated response stating that, no, the conservative brood won't be able to attend your nuptials — even if your relationship so far with your hubby-to-be consists of chaperoned dates and side hugs only. END
BEGIN HERE The email response begins with the Arkansas fam thanking their fans for reaching out, but due to the number of messages they get, they aren't able to personally respond to every single email. Hey, raising 19 kids eats up a lot of time! But then the clan drops the RSVP bomb. END
BEGIN HERE "Unfortunately, due to the number of invitations and our schedule," they wrote. "We cannot entertain invitations to personal events such as birthday parties and weddings. We wish we could go to everything!" Cross the Duggars' names off the guest list, guys. The fam is regretfully declining your invite. END
BEGIN HERE The email goes on to plug their book and the family's newsletter, before getting a little, uhh, preachy. "Above all, remember that God loves you so very much. He gave his only son, Jesus, that you may know God personally, have forgiveness for your sins and gain eternal life. Nothing in life is as important as this!" We're going to go ahead and assume that, in their opinion, that's gotta be much better than a wedding gift. END
BEGIN HERE We can't really blame the Duggars though for being too busy to attend the dozens of weddings they must be invited to on the reg. After all, they've got their own wedding to plan — that of daughter Jinger and her fiancé Jeremy Vuolo. Wonder if anyone will be sending them an email rejection to that RSVP... END
BEGIN HERE  A Lot of People Have RSVP'd 'No' to Our Wedding. What Should We Do? END
BEGIN HERE When you're choosing what to serve for dinner at your wedding, there's more to consider than just beef or fish. From allergies to vegetarians, it's a good idea to have choices so everyone can find something they'll enjoy. Another choice to add to the list? A kids' meal. Whether it's chicken fingers, pizza, or a dressed-down version of your roast chicken entree, having something little palates will enjoy will give you major bonus points with Mom and Dad. So how do you let the parents know there is a kids' meal available? Take a cue from our experts. END
BEGIN HERE If you are inviting a large number of children to your wedding, think about including kids' meal information in your invitation. If every couple with children is being invited as a family, include the kids' meal as an option on your RSVP card (and specify that it's for those under a certain age to ward off more humorous guests). Inviting some families but not others? Print an insert to tuck into certain invitations to let parents know that a child-friendly option is available without suggesting to those invited without their kids that little Tommy is actually on the guest list. END
BEGIN HERE This is also one of those wedding details that you can definitely share via e-mail. Gather up the addresses of all the parents with young children, then let them know that there is an additional option available. Confirm whether there are any allergies amongst the kids, then count up how many will be taking you up on your offer! END
BEGIN HERE Of course, you can also pick an age and decide that anyone under 12, for example, will be receiving the kids' meal, while anyone older will get an adult option. If you are inviting young kids but no teenagers, this is a great solution. Most four year olds will be much happier with macaroni and cheese than beef tenderloin! END

BEGIN HERE Ally Hilfiger, 31, and her boyfriend of six years, Steve Hash, got engaged in Paris last month according to People. Making the proposal moment even more magical, her fiancé presented her with a ring he had designed himself. The couple have a 17-month-old daughter together named Harley. END
BEGIN HERE "I was so surprised and overwhelmed with happiness and excitement," Ally told People. "We are having fun planning a lovely wedding at our family's home in Connecticut." END
BEGIN HERE Sadly, aside from a selfie of the couple posted on Hash's Instagram page (which you can see below), we have no details about their engagement, how he popped the question, or any of the planning details for their upcoming nuptials. However, it is hard to believe that anyone else would design her wedding dress aside from her father, one of the most famous American designers. His simple, all-American approach to wedding gowns would look lovely on his daughter, and we can't help but picture the Hilfiger family wedding following the same trend. If the wedding takes place at Tommy's Greenwich, Connecticut home, we imagine simplistic linens and lots of blues to compliment the town's natural rustic and colonial charm. END
BEGIN HERE But planning a wedding isn't the only thing on Ally's mind, thanks to the recent release of her first book, Bite Me. The book details Ally's history with Lyme disease. END
BEGIN HERE "It's very difficult to struggle in the public eye with Lyme disease because it's a very complicated disease," Hilfiger said in a previous interview with People. "You can really look great and be on one day and feel fine and happy and then the next day or five days or month and you can't get out of bed. It's crazy." END
BEGIN HERE Congratulations to Ally on her engagement, her new book release, and the custom Tommy Hilfiger gown she will no doubt walk down the aisle in! (Yes, we can't stop thinking about the dress possibilities. Can you blame us!? It's Tommy Hilfiger!) END

BEGIN HERE I think that wedding insurance has become more popular because brides and grooms are aware it exists now, whereas not that long ago, travel insurance was the only option, and that didn't cover anything more than the couple's cancelled trip. In fact, the popularity of wedding insurance has led companies to expand wedding coverage to include other planned events. END
BEGIN HERE Travelers Insurance recently released a fascinating study of what EXACTLY are the top claims brides and grooms have used their travel insurance to cover: END
BEGIN HERE  Do You Need Wedding Insurance? END
BEGIN HERE Just to be clear, wedding insurance doesn't cover rain on your wedding day just because you've always dreamed of saying "I do" under a clear blue sky. I asked the experts to explain how it works. END
BEGIN HERE "We understand that extreme or severe weather can happen unexpectedly — 16 percent of all wedding insurance claim payments over the past five years were due to weather. There is a difference, however, between a rainy day and truly catastrophic weather," says Ed Charlebois, Vice President of Personal Insurance at Travelers. "If catastrophic weather, such as a hurricane, causes cancellation or postponement of the wedding, we can provide reimbursement for certain non-recoverable expenses such as lost deposits, subject to the terms of the policy, of course." END
BEGIN HERE Unfortunately, it doesn't appear that any of the popular wedding insurance policies extend to weddings cancelled due to the Zika virus. It's considered a known risk the bride and groom took when they made their decision to get married in that location. END

After the reality star said a tearful goodbye to Robby, JoJo was "so ready" to present her final rose to Jordan (who also happens to be Aaron Rodgers' brother). "I'm so unbelievably in love with you," Jordan, in a crisp blue suit, said to JoJo (who was wearing a GORG off-white dress), before getting down on one knee and presenting her with a solitaire, oval-cut Neil Lane diamond set on a pavé band. The pair proclaimed "I love you" over and over again, before JoJo gifted Jordan with her final rose and they embraced each other in the sunset. END

BEGIN HERE Hayes then began his speech. "I'm here for Joelle, and I'm not going anywhere and she knows that," he said. "She means the world to me and I can sit here and honestly tell you both that she will be my number one priority in all of life and in everything I do." END
BEGIN HERE Addressing JoJo's father, Hayes continued: "Dr. Fletcher, in asking for your blessing to marry Joelle today, I don't just want her hand in marriage," he said as her mother gets emotional. "I want all that is Joelle Hannah Fletcher, because you guys have raised such a special girl." END
BEGIN HERE "If I'm fortunate enough to receive that blessing, I can promise you both to protect her, to care for her, to love her for my entire life and commitment is a lifetime thing," added Hayes.

BEGIN HERE She may have been the runner-up on Ben Higgin's season of The Bachelor, but this time around Bachelorette JoJo Fletcher has won at love — and in style. Last night, Fletcher chose Jordan Rodgers as the recipient of her final rose and in return received a stunning Neil Lane engagement ring from the former NFL quarterback. And although the oval-cut diamond sparkler certainly has us smitten, it was the no-longer-a-Bachelorette's dress that had us seriously swooning. The pale blush gown Fletcher wore during the finale was totally giving us rehearsal dinner and beach wedding vibes, and shockingly, the frock is totally affordable — if you know where to shop, that is! Brides-to-be, pull out those credit cards — your future rehearsal dinner or wedding dress now costs less than your bridal mani/pedi! END
BEGIN HERE For her final rose ceremony, Fletcher wore a Badgley Mischka chiffon gown. With its elegantly embroidered bodice and romantic flowing skirt, the look was delicate, dainty, and gorgeous enough to make anyone get down on one knee (just ask Jordan!). But don't let that fabulous designer label fool you into thinking that you're out of the running for donning Fletcher's dress for a pre-wedding party or your beach bash. The to-die-for frock that normally retails for a pricey $1,190 is now available for a mere $150 on Rent the Runway. Yes, really! END
BEGIN HERE "We were trying to go soft and delicate," The Bachelorette's stylist, Cary Fetman, explained to People magazine. Fletcher's finale dress — dubbed the "Blushing Ballerina Gown" — fit that vision to a tee. And if you're a bride-to-be going for a similar vibe during your nautical nuptials, Badgley Mischka's airy and ethereal frock might be just the wedding dress for you. Sure, Rent the Runway is a wardrobe renting service so you'd have to return the dress after the "I do's," but were you really planning on wearing your wedding gown more than once anyway? END

BEGIN HERE As if you needed another reason to snag the sweet chiffon dress for yourself — besides the fact that it's ridiculously beautiful, of course — it certainly seems to have had quite an effect on the fellas. Fletcher's sweetheart, Jordan Rodgers, is still smitten with his fiancé — and obviously that's all to do with her finale gown, right? Shortly after the final episode of The Bachelorette aired, Rodgers penned the most lovely of love letters to Fletcher, which he posted on Instagram. Captioning a photo of himself and his fiancé walking on the beach (with Fletcher still rocking the Badgley Mischka, of course), he wrote "When you look back at your life it's those little moments when one decision completely changes the course of your life. A few months ago I took a leap of faith that took me on a journey that lead me to the love of my life." END
BEGIN HERE "I love you more than anything!" the Bachelorette winner continued. "You are the most amazing woman on this planet, you are my best friend, and my rock. You are the best thing I wake up to in the morning and the last thing on my mind at night. Today is not the start of our love story, it's the start of a new chapter. I have grown to love you more and more with every passing day. I loved reliving the greatest day of our life tonight." (Clearly because of the dress right, Rodgers?) END
BEGIN HERE "You are my everything," the groom-to-be wrote, closing his sweet social media shoutout. "And I'm so ready to marry you and do life with you!" END

BEGIN HERE If Joe Biden plans to leave the political world come the end of his vice presidential term, it looks like he's all set to get into the wedding business. (Come join us, will you Joe?) The current vice president recently became a marriage officiant and presided over his very first same-sex wedding just last night, marrying two White House staffers in his Washington, D.C. home. Think Biden is taking requests for future to-be-wedded couples? Where can we sign up?! END
BEGIN HERE On Monday night, the U.S. Naval Observatory (a.k.a. the vice president's humble abode) was transformed into a wedding venue for two White House staffers: Brian Mosteller, the Oval Office operations director for President Barack Obama, and Joe Mahshie, a trip coordinator for First Lady Michelle Obama. According to CNN and an official statement from Biden's office, the now-newlyweds had asked Biden himself to marry them and the VP was all to happy to oblige after receiving temporary certification from the District of Columbia in order to officiate the sweet ceremony. END
BEGIN HERE Although the nuptials were only attended by the grooms' families, the wedding photo was soon seen by thousands, as Biden tweeted out an adorable pic of himself pronouncing Mosteller and Mahshie officially wed. "Proud to marry Brian and Joe at my house," Biden captioned the black-and-white wedding photo. "Couldn't be happier, two longtime White House staffers, two great guys." The vice president's wife, Dr. Jill Biden, later retweeted the sweet snapshot, declaring "Love is love!" Too sweet, right? END
BEGIN HERE Back in May of 2012, Biden publicly supported the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the highest-ranking American official of the time to endorse marriage equality (later to be dethroned when President Obama followed his VP's lead), making Biden the perfect choice as wedding officiant for these two grooms.

BEGIN HERE  Famous Same-Sex Couples Who Have Tied the Knot END
BEGIN HERE Colbee Ennis was on a tight budget for her May 2016 wedding. So the 25-year-old, living in Mt. Vernon, Oregon, found herself Googling "cheap wedding dress," hoping to find a decent replica of a fluffy white gown she'd seen while browsing a bridal Web site. With little hesitation, she bought one for $65 through an online retail giant from a third-party Chinese vendor that had a 97 percent approval rating. She knew it wasn't going to be as luxe as one from a designer's showroom, but, she says, "I was just going to wear it once, so that was fine with me." END
BEGIN HERE Fine, that is, until the dress arrived. Ennis unwrapped the box to find a lipstick-red tulle puffball reeking of formaldehyde. Beads around the neckline and waist had been attached using a hot-glue gun, leaving strands of glue stuck to the fabric. And, again, it was red! The sizing was way off — "My five-year-old would have fit better in that dress," she says — and there was no packing slip or return address. Online, Ennis found a return policy requiring an "approval process," she says. "They were going to charge another $15. At that point, I said screw it. It wasn't worth it." With just a few months left before her wedding, Ennis did what few brides would even consider: She borrowed a wedding dress from a generous friend. END
BEGIN HERE We live in an age of knockoff fashion. Thanks to the international e-commerce boom, New York City's Canal Street has been replaced by shady vendors on familiar third-party megasites and online knockoff emporiums based abroad. In some cases, they're hawking outright counterfeits and their name-brand merchandise is anything but. In others, it's just a misrepresentation of goods for sale; what's promised (in images or descriptions or both) is not what's provided. As a result, consumers are getting fooled (or they're in on the joke): The global counterfeit trade is nearly $500 billion a year, according to a 2016 report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In 2014 alone, the Department of Homeland Security seized $1.22 billion worth of products — most originating from China — found to infringe on intellectual-property rights. END
BEGIN HERE And the bridal world is taking its share of the hit. Industry insiders estimate that manufacturers, stores, and designers in the U.S. are losing millions annually to counterfeiting. Horror stories abound at places like BridalBeware.com, a vigilante site that invites victims of online scammers to share their stories and photos. One bride told of a pale-blush ruched organza gown that arrived in a Day-Glo pink instead. For another, what was supposed to be a Vera Wang lace tea-length number turned out to be ill-fitting shreds of tulle. For a third, a copy of Kate Middleton's Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen masterpiece showed up looking like a high school home-ec project, with cheap materials and distorted proportions. END
BEGIN HERE These stories are becoming commonplace as brides grow more comfortable shopping for high-end gowns online but remain unfamiliar with the process of commissioning a made-to-order dress. This is likely the first and last piece of custom clothing most women will buy, and counterfeiters are happy to exploit their ignorance — and wedding budgets, since the gown will also be the most expensive single piece of clothing many will ever buy. "These operators are completely unregulated and prey on the fact that everyone wants a deal," says Hitha Herzog, author of Black Market Billions: How Organized Retail Crime Funds Global Terrorists. They steal the images from designers' sites, upload them to their own, and claim to offer the real thing for a fraction of the price. "When you search for 'inexpensive bridal gowns,' you'll see them. They pay a lot to come up first," explains bridal-industry vet Hedy Lapkin, executive director of the International Bridal Manufacturers Association. "A girl will have fallen in love with a $2,000 dress, and then here it is for $300 or $400. Sellers know the customer has never bought a wedding gown before, and maybe her budget is small. This is how they get to them." END
BEGIN HERE Retail giant David's Bridal is a frequent target. A recent search on one Chinese Web site unearthed listings for the store's Truly Zac Posen designs that used original images swiped from David's Bridal's online store. A mermaid style that retails for $750 is listed for $178. David's has the resources to fight back, and it does, says Trevor Lunn, David's chief customer officer. "We're careful to create dresses that don't infringe on other people's designs, and in turn, we don't tolerate when others attempt to copy our designs or use our imagery without consent," he says. "We use a domain-monitoring service, send cease-and-desist letters, and contact ISP providers when we encounter copyright, trademark, or imagery infringement. And we've filed suits against foreign Web sites." END
BEGIN HERE Boutique designers like Claire Pettibone are at risk too. "We've had brides call us in tears when they receive a counterfeit gown and it looks nothing like the original design," she says. "These sites steal our photos and use our name. Our core clients know the difference, but the aspirational bride, who maybe has a budget under $1,000, is the most vulnerable." Pettibone's legal team sends cease-and-desist letters to offending sites with some success, but it's difficult to monitor, she says. END
BEGIN HERE Katharine Polk, of indie label Houghton, is resigned to the fact that copycats are waiting to pounce. "We just have to rely on the fact that clients understand we're doing better quality and that our fabrics are exclusive," she says. "Beyond that, there's not much I can do to protect my designs." British bridal mainstay (and Duchess of Cambridge go-to) Jenny Packham also relies on brand loyalty to steer customers away from counterfeiters. "When we launched [our bridal line] in 1997, we offered something different for a fashion-forward bride," she says. "Now there's much more choice and competition. The replication of our designs, to varying degrees, has become a constant." But, she says, customers who value innovative design, quality, and service will always choose the real deal. END
BEGIN HERE As it's nearly impossible to copyright a dress design, brands that choose to sue focus on the stolen images used on Web sites. Stephen N. Lang, chief executive of Mon Cheri Bridals and president of the American Bridal & Prom Industry Association (ABPIA), has won a lawsuit against sites like TuteraBridal.com — which purported to sell designs from Mon Cheri designer David Tutera — and MoncheryBridal.com. (See what they did there?) Typically, these companies — many of which are foreign — don't have representation in American courts, so they're simply shut down by the U.S. government. If they do have a legal team, they'll often pay to settle out of court and close operations. END
BEGIN HERE "Mon Cheri is a $100 million company," says Lang, "but I'm probably bleeding $10 million in lost revenue a year because of this. Maybe more." Lang started the ABPIA in 2012 so that designers, manufacturers, and retailers of all sizes could band together to fight counterfeiters, and he says his organization has closed down roughly 1,500 sites already. "The problem is that as soon as you shut one down, it pops up again under a new name," he says. END
BEGIN HERE Complicating matters is the fact that Lang produces his gowns in China, as do many manufacturers: It's the number-one source of wedding dresses in the world. The vast majority of American brides will walk the aisle in an authentic, well-made gown created (or at least assembled) there. But just like many of his luxury-goods counterparts, he's caught one of his own manufacturers selling knockoffs of his gowns on the side. "I've visited our factories in Chaozhou and found my product being bootlegged," he says, adding that his entreaties to the trade groups who meet with the Chinese government have had little effect. But while this practice is part of the problem, the majority of counterfeit fashion is coming from another factory town, Suzhou, known for its apparel copying, where exploitative bosses drive teams of inexperienced sewers to copy dresses from images they find on the Web, without the benefit of patterns or samples. END
BEGIN HERE And the reality of fashion counterfeiting is that there are plenty of consumers who don't actually care whether they're getting the real thing. "We're dealing with gowns that are in the thousands and tens of thousands of dollars, and sometimes the consumer becomes an accomplice in the knockoff process," says Susan Scafidi, founder and president of the Fashion Law Institute at Fordham University. "If money is no object and you can pay $15,000 or $30,000 for your gown, then you're probably not looking for a copy. But for a bride who has a dress budget of $1,000, it becomes tempting to pay 10 or 20 percent of that." And there's always that one friend of a friend who was happy with her knockoff. END
BEGIN HERE But all of that ignores counterfeiting's real victims: Bootlegging factories in Asia and, more recently, Africa often exploit their workers with atrocious conditions, unlivable wages, and no compensation for overtime. In the most extreme cases, sweatshops are part of international criminal syndicates. "That means human trafficking, terrorist funding, and money laundering for [drug] cartels," says Herzog. In Suzhou, there have been reports of factories employing underage workers. Sweatshop inspectors have told stories of floors covered in garbage, filthy bathrooms, and 15-hour workdays with just a 30-minute break. In her book Deluxe: How Luxury Lost Its Luster, reporter Dana Thomas recounted entering a factory where children under 10 years old were forced to sew knockoff handbags. As if that weren't horrible enough, they'd had their legs broken and tied together so they wouldn't heal properly — for asking to go outside and play. Everyone loves a bargain, but most women wouldn't want to dress for the happiest day of her life in a gown made by the tiny fingers of a tortured child. END
BEGIN HERE So how do you get your dream dress on a real-life budget, without taking away from a designer's work or supporting a hideous industry? The surest way would be not to buy online from an unfamiliar source; it's easy to be drawn in by shady manufacturers, especially if they're selling through reputable marketplaces and have faked their own reviews to boost their approval ratings. (Most legit third-party auction sites and marketplaces — you know them; you've used them — have policies prohibiting the trade of phony goods, but it's a lot like playing Whack-a-Mole: Shut one illegal vendor down and another appears.) If you're buying your dress on the Web, before you click "Purchase," call the designer's customer-service number to confirm that you're dealing with an authorized dealer. You can also look for mentions of import duties. If a site tries to pin those taxes on a buyer, it's probably a counterfeit operation, Lang says. But our best advice is this: If you're on a tight budget, you're better off buying a less-expensive authentic dress than a knockoff of a pricey one. Because, with wedding gowns as with most things, you get what you pay for. END

BEGIN HERE     The 33-year-old football star got married on Saturday, July 23 at the Peabody in Memphis, Tennessee. There, they created a zombie-themed wedding based on the hit TV series, US Weekly reports. "I'm a huge Walking Dead fan," he explained in an interview with ESPN. "I wanted to do engagement photos of us being chased by zombies and we didn't have time because it was during season and we didn't have the opportunity, so [my wife, Risalyn] was like, 'How are you going to pull that off?'"  Surprisingly, the bride didn't need to be convinced much further to have a gory bridal party aesthetic based on the comic book series-turned-television show. "He didn't have to convince me," Risalyn shared with the sports network while wearing full zombie makeup in her wedding gown. But, the bridesmaids' opinions were a different story. "He really had to convince the bridesmaids, and then he said they had to do it because they're bridesmaids." Groomzillas, take note!  END

BEGIN HERE      Photo: Youtube    END
BEGIN HERE So while most brides and grooms are sweating for the wedding, these two decided to "bleed" for it. They hired professional makeup artists to transform the entire wedding party into walking corpses, complete with mangled faces and blood. "It's a time for us to laugh and say, 'Ha, you look goofy,'" he said. "It gives us a chance to step outside our comfort zone and put on our acting skills, whether we possess them or not." END
BEGIN HERE walking dead bridal party END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Youtube    END
BEGIN HERE The result? A wedding day filled with zombie-walks, running, screaming, and fake blood, to many wedding videographers' dismay (or excitement). ESPN was there to cover the event, and in the video, Williams is seen running from his bridal party, who are already zombies. The short film takes you through several scenes from the big day, with the bride and groom eventually turning into zombies themselves — quite the happy ending in Walking Dead world. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Youtube    END
BEGIN HERE   Growing up, the football star loved horror movies — and once Walking Dead came about, he grew obsessed with the post-apocalyptic TV show. "It is a dream come true," Williams told ESPN of his wedding day. "What makes it even more magical is not only did I become a walker, I became a husband." Instead of all the feels, we're experiencing all the squeals — such a gruesome-yet-happily ever after story. END

BEGIN HERE Excuse us while we currently freak the F out about our beloved celeb couple, Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth, releasing the absolute CUTEST Instagram video of all time. The A-listers have been the stars of the Internet lately since Cyrus began sporting her engagement ring again earlier this year, fueling rumors about possible weddings in the future (yes, plural), but this vid is solidified proof that the duo is head-over-heels in love. END
BEGIN HERE In the clip, which features Cyrus' adorable pooch, Barbie Da Beagle, you can hear Hemsworth singing Justin Bieber's smash hit "Love Yourself" in the background, as the "We Can't Stop" superstar sings her own rendition into the camera. Clearly these two are beliebers! At the end of the vid posted to Miley's Instagram account, we totally get a kick out of Hemsworth teasing his girlfriend(/fiancée/wifey?), who doesn't exactly appreciate his humor as she snaps back, "Babe stop, seriously." END
BEGIN HERE Awww, she called him babe! This literally makes our hearts so happy it's almost embarrassing. The last time we felt this happy was probably when the pair sang to each other in an old pickup truck in The Last Song. Seriously, just watch it and TRY not to smile/bawl your hopeless romantic eyes out. END
BEGIN HERE Though there's no word yet on exactly when these two are getting married, there have been plenty of rumors that the couple will have two weddings (one in California and one in Hemsworth's homeland, Australia) sometime in August. Billy Ray Cyrus himself even hinted that he might be the officiant come wedding bells time. Not only that, but the Hannah Montana star went so far as to get a Vegemite tattoo on her arm, permanently showing her love for Hemsworth and his home roots. END
BEGIN HERE  Liam Hemsworth Basically Just Confirmed His Engagement to Miley Cyrus END
BEGIN HERE She even shocked her fanbase last week when she sported a diamond band on THAT finger, confusing us all to no end. Are they married? Are they even engaged? WHAT IS GOING ON?! The world may never know. What we do know is if there's still a wedding to be had, we're crossing our fingers to get on the Milliam nuptials guest list. Anyone else? END
BEGIN HERE Wedding dress codes are complicated for everyone, including the bride and groom. You know not to shop for super-formal ball gowns for your beach wedding, and there are some groom looks that are more appropriate for a daytime celebration than an evening in a ballroom. But cocktail attire? That's a gray area that's often open to interpretation (and input from the type of venue and season you've chosen). So even if your wedding is cocktail attire, is it okay for the groom to wear a tux? Our experts weigh in. END
BEGIN HERE While tuxedos are usually reserved for black tie events, if your wedding dress code is "cocktail attire" but will run on the dressier side, your groom should be able to pull off a tux. You have a few options for keeping his look from appearing as though he's dressed for a different event entirely. END
BEGIN HERE The first option is to have the groomsmen wear suits that are the same color as the groom's tuxedo (most likely black). By having them dress down slightly while still matching, he'll stand out as the man of the hour, whereas an entire wedding party in formalwear could make guests feel underdressed. END
BEGIN HERE Another choice is to have him wear a non-traditional tuxedo. Navy blue tuxes are all the rage, and look sharp with black lapels and a black bowtie. He could wear a full navy blue tux, or black pants with a navy tuxedo jacket. Tuxedos also come in charcoal gray, which are a modern option that's a little more casual. END
BEGIN HERE And of course, remember that it's your wedding! If the two of you want to dress a little more formal (and it fits with your theme and your venue), by all means, go for it! No one will fault a bride or groom for wanting to dress up on their wedding day. END

BEGIN HERE Just one day after exchanging vows at their glamorous wedding, Robert Herjavec and Kym Johnson have already become #marriagegoals. END
BEGIN HERE The Shark Tank star hosted a party the day after his wedding for Liam Brenes, a 4-year-old boy whose prosthetic leg was stolen after swimming at Crystal Cove State Beach in Orange County with his family, People reports. Brenes was born without a fibula and his right leg amputated from below the knee when he was 1-year-old. The boy had been trying to protect his prosthetic leg while swimming in the salt water, and returned from his swim to find the leg missing. END
BEGIN HERE After hearing this, Herjavec had offered to fund a replacement leg for Brenes, which is now Ghostbusters-themed, and has promised him a party to celebrate his new leg. The new groom filled the party with lots of excitement and surprises, including Ghostbusters toys, gifts, and an appearance by Noah Galloway, a double-amputee Iraq War veteran who competed against Herjavec and Johnson on Dancing With the Stars. END
BEGIN HERE That isn't even all of the surprises that Herjavec has in store for Brenes! According to People, the Shark Tank star previously agreed to send Brenes on a special trip to Disneyland. END
BEGIN HERE "We're going to arrange to have him to a VIP tour of Disney and get to go to the park and have some fun in life because it's good to have fun in life," Herjavec said. END
BEGIN HERE This heartwarming story happened hours after Herjavec and Johnson said "I do" in a gorgeous Beverly Hills wedding. The bride wore a custom Monique Lhuillier gown while the groom wore a white and black tuxedo. The dancing couple even performed two first dances for their guests; the first was a traditional first dance to Etta James' "At Last," while the second was a group performance with the bridal party to LunchMoney Lewis' "Bills." END

BEGIN HERE Move aside, bachelor parties — the latest (and dare we say greatest) trend happening amongst our male counterparts is making waves in the Pinterest world. The trend, known as the "dadchelor" party, took off in 2015 after more and more men began searching Pinterest for a way to have a baby shower of their own, complete with brews and poker of course. Much like the bachelor party, the man shower (which isn't as fun to say as dadchelor, TBH) is a guy's last hurrah before fatherhood and is the perfect way for a dad-to-be to celebrate this momentous occasion with none other than his closest bros. END

BEGIN HERE And while yes, the dadchelor party involves beer, it's probably a liiitle bit different than the college-esque frat party you're imagining. For example, the most popular man shower ideas on Pinterest include "Beer, Dudes & Diapers" and "Chuggers and Huggies." Instead of chugging beer from the can, men are now celebrating fatherhood by chugging their brews out of a baby's bottle. Nope, we're not making this up! END
BEGIN HERE  [](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/455215474817360256/)  END
BEGIN HERE There are more generic man shower ideas, like hosting a backyard BBQ or a simple Poker night, but we have to admit we'd PAY to see our guys go the more non-traditional route by wearing a T-shirt that reads, "The man behind the bump" while toting a six-pack of Bud Light in one hand and a box of diapers in the other. #InstagramWorthy END
BEGIN HERE Activity ideas from the dadchelor party Pinterest board include a diaper changing relay race, baby mad libs, and of course lots and lots of beer-themed basics — like this baby is brewing beer tap. Hey, a lot is changing for your man, too! He deserves to let loose one last time before everything in his life does a 180. We're talking late-night rock-a-bye baby sessions, Saturday night's in, and most importantly, less free time to do just about, well... anything. But if you're still not keen on the idea, co-ed baby showers have also majorly increased in popularity since 2015. And the trend is only just beginning to gain speed. END
BEGIN HERE  [](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/242209286186257632/)  END

We just can't get enough of their sweet story! And now this sneak peek video of Counting On's second season has us breaking out the Kleenex. END
BEGIN HERE In the clip, we see the 22-year-old Duggar daughter — who, if you aren't familiar, is one of 19 Duggar kids who rose to fame with the family's original TLC reality show 19 Kids and Counting — excitedly yell "Jeremy!" as Vuolo walks into her family's Arkansas home with flowers in hand and says, "I missed you." END
BEGIN HERE Later in the sneak peek, the officially courting duo can be seen sitting on a porch bench together, People reports. "It's really been a privilege for me to get to know you," 28-year-old Vuolo says before the camera focuses on Jinger's face. "I wanted to ask you if you would..." END
BEGIN HERE CLEARLY this is the major proposal moment we've all been desperately waiting for, right?! END
BEGIN HERE Jinger, who has already watched her two older sisters, Jill and Jessa, walk down the aisle in recent years, announced that she was being courted — the Duggar family-approved form of dating that consists of no sex, no kissing, chaperoned dates, and side-hugs only — by the pro athlete just last month, after meeting Vuolo in May 2015 and attending a mission trip together. "It was there that I really saw his heart and really admired his character," Jinger explained to to People at the time. END
BEGIN HERE According to People, the 10-episode series will also focus on Duggar daughter Jessa and her husband Ben Seewald — they married in a much-publicized religious wedding in November 2014 — and their hopes for adoption. "Ben and I have had on our hearts to adopt," 23-year-old Jessa, who gave birth to their first son in November, says in the video. "That was something that we talked about before we were even married." END
BEGIN HERE Not so surprisingly, Jessa and Ben won't be the only Duggars looking to expand the family! Other Duggar daughter Jill's 27-year-old husband Derick Dillard says to her that he's set on "trying to have another baby before next year."

BEGIN HERE If JoJo Fletcher had any doubts about her choice on Monday's season finale of The Bachelorette, we're sure the diamond engagement ring Jordan Rodgers proposed with squashed them with its shine. We're not saying the woman is shallow, but have you seen that thing?! The new beautiful bauble that has since taken up residence on Fletcher's finger is sparkly enough to stop traffic! It's been two whole days now since we watched Rodgers get down on one knee, and we're still not over that engagement ring. Where do we get one of those beauties?! From Neil Lane, of course — the resident ring designer of The Bachelor franchise. But unfortunately, it comes with a price tag just as hefty as everyone's hatred for this season's villain, Chad Johnson. (Sorry, Chad...) END
BEGIN HERE As per usual with all Bachelor and Bachelorette cast members, Rodgers enlisted the help of jewelry designer Neil Lane (good gig he's got there, right?) to create the perfect engagement ring for his future bride-to-be. And as always, Lane came through. The former football quarterback eventually settled on a platinum sparkler featuring an oval-cut center stone surrounded by a halo of over 155 pavé diamonds. Le sigh... END
BEGIN HERE "I knew right away which one I wanted for her," Rodgers told People of his spot-on choice. The engagement ring weighs in at 3.75 carats, according to E! News, and cost an estimated — wait for it... —  END

BEGIN HERE TGFIS — that's short for "Thank God for Instagram Stories" and in this case it's because we may have just found out that Bethenny Frankel is engaged! The Skinny Girl mogul flashed a quick peek at a huge diamond ring on her left finger on Instagram Stories Wednesday morning, leading us to believe that the Real Housewives of New York City star might be getting married to her boyfriend Dennis Shields. END
BEGIN HERE While we're unsure if the engagement ring pics are real or just a maj dig at her frenemy and fellow Housewife, Luann de Lesseps (as the two have had reoccurring beef on-screen, most recently over Luann's engagement to Tom D'Agostino), the reality star posted not one, but TWO photos with the sparkly bling on her left finger. In one photo, the Skinny Girl founder is taking a selfie in which she is wearing sunglasses while hugging a man who appears to be her 48-year-old boyfriend (or fiancé?), Shields (but might we say his bald head resembles D'Agostino's...!?). He is facing away from the selfie camera, and her arm is wrapped around his head with a diamond ring in plain sight. END
BEGIN HERE bethenny frankel engaged END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Courtesy Bethenny Frankel via Instagram    END
BEGIN HERE If we can just stop for a second to note that the ring is literally GINORMOUS — easily several carats, if not more. The only thing that is very suspicious about the new bling is how similar it looks to the Countess' yellow diamond with two white diamonds flanking the sides. The difference with Frankel's sparkler is that her center stone is a white diamond as well. Needless to say, it's huge and gorgeous — definitely giving Kim K a run for her money. In a separate Snapchat post, the author and chef is taking a selfie in a tank top and underwear, with the ring peeking around her ring finger in the snap. It's all so intriguing, and we're not sure what to make of it. END

BEGIN HERE Frankel and Shields started dating this year, after rumors started swirling upon being spotted together in New York City. While her first marriage to Jason Hoppy (and subsequent divorce) was made totally public, the Bravo star revealed to People that her new relationship will be quite different. "I haven't been this happy in a really long time, and I'm continuing with my policy of not involving [others] in my relationships, because it certainly has served me wrong in the past. You know the definition of insanity is repeating the same behavior and expecting different results, so I'm not going to make the same mistake twice. So, if I'm happy in a relationship, I want to keep it private for as long as I can. It has not worked out with me well in the past to be gushing over being really happy — I'll leave that part to my castmates." END
BEGIN HERE Since that time, however, they've been seen out and about in various locales. The reality star has also been seen rocking a diamond ring on her right ring finger, and posting Instagram snaps of flowers from her man, captioned "So lucky." END
BEGIN HERE bethenny frankel engaged to dennis shields END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Getty Images    END
BEGIN HERE The pair met 27 years ago, ironically when B's NYC banker beau was dating (and then ended up marrying) one of her high school girlfriends. And while they both have a little relationship baggage to handle (word on the street is that Shields is still married, and Frankel's divorce was just solidified), the RHONY star is totally owning it. "We've both been married and separated," she shared with People. 'So we're a perfect match. Like everything else in my life, I'm owning it." END
BEGIN HERE Either way, bring on the dramz, as this sneaky Instagram announcement is sure to bring some (most likely unwanted) opinions from her Bravo castmates. We can't wait to see how it all unfolds. One thing is for sure: We'll be pretty mad if all this ring business is just a cruel joke to get us excited. END
BEGIN HERE Whether you're the bride, bridesmaid, mother of the bride, or a guest, there's one thing that can strike fear in the hearts of wedding-goers searching for perfect hair — summer humidity. If you're in a remote, tropical destination with no access to a trustworthy salon, or are just a girl who likes to get in the trenches with her hair, the truth is doing your own hair for a summer wedding shouldn't be out of the question. Of course, there are a few tips and tricks that will help you along the way. Here, the 4 secrets to doing your own summer wedding hair, and getting it right every time! END
BEGIN HERE   Nothing beats humidity quite like some seriously textured hair. The secret to achieving that perfectly tousled texture? Lots of dry shampoo! We're all admitted dry shampoo addicts around here $ the perfect hair staple is not only great for refreshing a days-old blow out (shhhh we'll never tell the last time we washed), it's also the secret to achieving that sexy bedhead level of volume and texture, you know the one that's perfect for holding an updo or romantic beach waves in place. Focus on a talc-free product like Big Sexy Hair Volumizing Dry Shampoo, to absorb impurities and build-up from other products while achieving the kind of volume usually reserved for Victoria's Secret models. Keep that hair in place with a hairspray that holds without drying up your tresses (or making them feel all crunchy). Big Sexy Hair Get Layered Flash Dry Thickening Hairspray not only keeps your hair in place, but also shields away humidity, and UVA/UVB rays — perfect for beach brides looking for extra protection and a gorgeous 'do.

BEGIN HERE In an interview about her engagement with TooFab, Cannatella admitted that she was completely surprised by the proposal because she thought she was just enjoying a casual Sunday brunch with her now-fiancé and her sister. END
BEGIN HERE "My engagement was amazing," Cannatella said. "He completely surprised me. We went to brunch at Brennan's with my sister then walked outside and saw my best friend standing there with a few friends listening to a jazz band. I thought we just ran into them randomly then we walked down the street and I saw more of my friends." END
BEGIN HERE "At that point, I realized that the jazz band was following us and we had police escorts," Canatella explained. "Then ran into more friends who gave me a parasol. So we all danced down the street in the French Quarter until we reached Jackson Square and my daddy and step mom and more friends were there and he got down on one knee in the park in front of the church with the band playing! It was insane. He had to get a city permit for the second line and everything, I was so shocked. He did so well with the ring too!!" END
BEGIN HERE Shortly after getting engaged, Cannatella wrote on Twitter, "Soooooo in other news....some poor guy asked me to be his wife. And I said hell yes." You can see the post below. END

Okay, so her current sweetheart Blake Shelton technically isn't her hubby-to-be (yet!), but the country crooner recently surpised the pop princess when she was hard at work on her concert tour. He even joined her on stage for a to-die-for duet! Way cooler than the time your fiancé stopped by your office with lunch for two, right? (Although that was pretty adorable...) But these too-cute photos of the in-love pair cuddled up on stage are just adding fuel to the engagement gossip fire, as they seem to confirm the rumor that the pair are heading down the aisle soon — very soon. END
BEGIN HERE On Tuesday, Stefani and Shelton proved just how inseparable they've been as of late when Shelton stopped by the Detroit leg of Stefani's This Is What the Truth Feels Like tour. According to Entertainment Tonight, the Voice coach hopped up on stage with Stefani to tag-team their hit "Go Ahead and Break My Heart," surprising the audience (and probably giving a few of them heart attacks in the process!). The pair previously performed the duet on The Voice back in May — but they didn't share a kiss on stage afterwards! Yep, that's right. This time, after that last note was sung, the pair adorably embraced and Stefani pecked Shelton on the cheek in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment (video below). And if that wasn't cute enough, the couple also snapped a slew of silly shots backstage, which Stefani later posted to Instagram. END
BEGIN HERE How could you not be hearing wedding bells after seeing that, right? You can't play coy with us, you two! In fact, how lovey-dovey Shelton and Stefani were last night supports the latest rumor about the future of their relationship. "They are not engaged yet," a source close to the "Make Me Like You" singer recently divulged to People. "Everyone is expecting it to happen at some point, though." Obviously! We already dreamed up all their wedding details, after all! END
BEGIN HERE "Their relationship is almost too good to be true," the source continued. "They are very much alike and really have a very special relationship. All the things that need to work out for two people to merge lives have worked out." That sounds promising, right? Fingers crossed those Shelton/Stefani nuptials happen soon!

BEGIN HERE "We waited until the next weekend so we didn't feel rushed after the wedding. It gave us time to unwind at home and get ready to travel. I was so busy finalizing wedding plans and entertaining relatives from out of town that I can't imagine if I had to have everything packed for the honeymoon." — Sarah END
BEGIN HERE "We left for our honeymoon the day after our wedding. My husband and I are both attorneys and have pretty crazy work schedules. Leaving right away was perfect for us because we were able to plan our time off and not have to worry about going back to the office in between the wedding and honeymoon. Had we waited, we inevitably would have had lingering tasks hanging over our heads for our big day." —Brittany END
BEGIN HERE "We got married in May and decided to postpone our honeymoon to early January. It was much harder than I thought it would be to return to work two days after the wedding. I had a really hard time focusing the first few weeks back, and it just felt like a major buzz kill after all of the fun and special moments of the wedding week. On the other hand, we still have the honeymoon to look forward to as the post-wedding blues set in, and we are taking the time to plan it now versus during the stress of planning the wedding." —Emily END
BEGIN HERE "We left for our honeymoon in St. Lucia the day after the wedding. I wanted to sort of ride the high we were on from the last couple of days. Yes, we were exhausted, but what does it matter when you have seven days of lying on a beach drinking pina coladas ahead of you? If we had done our originally planned trip to Tokyo and Bali, I might have considered waiting because that was more of an adventure trip without as much relaxation time. But if you're doing a tropical, relaxing trip, keep the party going and go right away!" —Carolyn END
BEGIN HERE "We got married in August and didn't honeymoon until February, though we did go to Maine for a few days as a 'mini moon' to unwind from wedding chaos. I would definitely do it the same way again. We had something exciting to look forward to during those months in between." —Jordan END
BEGIN HERE "We waited one week, and it felt like an eternity. I went back to work for a few days, and it was such a buzz kill. I highly recommend keeping the high going and leaving right away if possible!" —Jaclyn END
BEGIN HERE "We left two days after the wedding. We had all day Sunday to wind down and enjoy actual one-on-one time with a few family members and friends that came from out of town. The wedding was a great party, but as with any awesome big party, it's hard to really spend time with all the guests." —Meghan END
BEGIN HERE "We left for our honeymoon the next day and took a redeye. It was so nice to just leave right away and a perfect way to start off married life. Planning a wedding and working full time is super stressful, and it was nice to get away, relax, and be alone together." —Lauren END

Ryan was a complete gentleman, asking for Kathryn's number and taking her out to dinner later that week. A year and a day after that first date (and two rescue dogs later!), Kathryn watched as the youth lacrosse team Ryan coaches won their big game and posed for a celebratory photo. But it wasn't the snapshot she was expecting. "When I looked over, they were all holding up cards that spelled out 'Will You Marry Me' and Ryan was on bended knee!" she says. END

"The grounds are gorgeous, and the waterfront location meant we could have a ceremony with the sea in the background," says Kathryn. The twosome planned a sophisticated garden wedding for August 29, 2015, drawing inspiration from the Inn's property and incorporating a relaxed, nautical vibe with help from Elizabeth Duncan Events. From watercolor illustrations to soft raspberry blooms against boxwood bushes, the celebration perfectly captured who Ryan and Kathryn are as a couple. "It was a true escape for our guests, and all the details highlighted that relaxed, elegant style," says the bride.

BEGIN HERE Kathryn loves watercolor painting (and dabbles in it herself), so she and Ryan worked with Inslee by Design to create a custom botanic motif in soft blush and peach hues. The floral design was used on everything from the invitation suite to the welcome boxes. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Lisa Blume Photography    END
BEGIN HERE "It was amazing how many ways our planner and the stationery designer were able to use the watercolor floral print," says Kathryn. Repeating the design from the beginning of the event to the day's final moments helped tie together the secret garden theme. END

BEGIN HERE Kathryn was head-over-heels for her textured blush and ivory bouquet. "I really wanted peonies, but they weren't in season, so I settled on garden roses, dahlias, and veronica. Our planner found peonies online two days before the wedding, and had them shipped overnight as a surprise to tuck into my bouquet!" END
BEGIN HERE Her bridesmaids all wore blush pink Donna Morgan gowns with strapless bodices and flowing skirts. "I knew they would want to dance all night, so I picked a style that would be comfortable and easy to move in," says the thoughtful bride. END

BEGIN HERE The couple had two flower girls, who both wore white and pink organza dresses with a flower at the waist. Instead of baskets of petals, the girls carried a garland of greenery and garden roses down the aisle. END

BEGIN HERE The ceremony overlooked the Miles River, which feeds into the Chesapeake Bay. An arbor of boxwood was draped with billowing white fabric, and topiaries of roses flanked the aisle. The front row on either side of the aisle was comprised of mismatched chairs in cream and white hues. END
BEGIN HERE "Ryan insisted that we write our own vows, and we ended up saying incredibly similar things to one another," says Kathryn. "It's as if we knew what the other person was going to write!" END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Lisa Blume Photography    END
BEGIN HERE After the ceremony, the bride and groom took to the Inn's grounds for portraits. Kathryn stunned in a fluted Romona Keveza wedding dress with re-embroidered lace details and cap sleeves. "I realized all the dresses I loved were by the same designer, and I liked each one that I tried on more than the last. Seven or so dresses later, I'd found the perfect one!" says the bride. She swapped the standard white shantung lining with blush pink for a little extra contrast. But even a shopping story that successful comes with a warning: "During my final fitting, I tried on one more dress that had just arrived at the salon. It was completely different from what I chose, and I was curious so I tried it on just for fun. I don't know what I was thinking!" Kathryn loved the dress, and worried that she'd made the wrong choice. Thankfully, with some reassurance from her bridesmaids, she remembered why she loved the first gown she'd chosen — and is so glad she didn't change her mind at the last minute! END
BEGIN HERE Finding the perfect balance between a formal wedding and the afternoon outdoor setting, Ryan wore a gray slim-fit Black by Vera Wang tuxedo. "It was unique, but still classic," says Kathryn. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Lisa Blume Photography    END
BEGIN HERE    The reception took place in a tent on the Inn's lawn, with an archway draped in greenery and blooms marking the entrance.  END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Lisa Blume Photography    END
BEGIN HERE Instead of traditional escort cards, table assignments were printed onto paper leaves that were tucked into garlands of roses, accented with watercolor butterflies and ladybugs. Says Kathryn, "I loved them! They were just the right touch of whimsy." END
BEGIN HERE Before entering the tent, guests sipped cocktails (including a non-alcoholic rosemary lemonade and a bourbon, ginger beer, and lemon Shoofly Punch) on the lawn. Even the cocktail napkins featured the floral print used on the invitations! END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Lisa Blume Photography    END
BEGIN HERE Inside the tent, round tables were topped with blush linens, while long tables were topped with cloths in light green. Boxwood hedges and rose topiaries marked the corners, with white vases full of blush and pink roses in the middle of the room. END
BEGIN HERE In low silver urns, dahlias were tucked between garden roses and veronica, with a few blooms in brighter pink for contrast. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Lisa Blume Photography    END
BEGIN HERE Gold-rimmed chargers featured illustrations of leaves and dragonflies. Those mismatched chairs from the ceremony made another appearance at the head table, where they added a vintage, eclectic vibe to the romantic setting. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Lisa Blume Photography    END
BEGIN HERE The tables topped with green linens featured white chargers with cutout details. In the bar area, a round couch flaunted sequined and plaid pink pillows, topped off with dozens of pink roses. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Lisa Blume Photography    END
BEGIN HERE The pair's three-tiered wedding cake also featured the watercolor design used on the invitations, painstakingly applied to off-white fondant. Two tiers were red velvet cake, while the third was a coconut cake with fresh strawberry filling. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Lisa Blume Photography    END
BEGIN HERE "I'm a little obsessed with music, and it was important to me that we have an epic dance party," says Kathryn. She and Ryan worked with their DJ to create a diverse and dynamic playlist — and it was a smashing success. "Our guests said it was the best dance party they'd ever been to!" END
BEGIN HERE At the end of the night, Kathryn and Ryan made a photo-worthy exit beneath a shower of rose petals. "My best advice is to definitely have a first look," says the bride. "It was so romantic and meaningful to have time together, just the two of us, to wander through the gardens. It helped us connect and be even more present during our ceremony." END

BEGIN HERE After saying your vows and eating an incredible meal, the perfect wedding is usually accomplished with a full night with your friends and family dancing under the stars. Top 40 bands have some catchy beats and latin flare can get the dance floor grooving, but sometimes a couple is begging for songs from another era — that guests across generations will know and love. Whether you're the couple that prefers Frank Sinatra's well-known hits or the couple that wants the vintage rock of '70s Rolling Stones, the below bands provide you with the best of Miami while celebrating your wedding reception in the way you've always dreamed.

BEGIN HERE Usually the bride gets a bad rap as a bridezilla. But in these instances, it's clear the crazy culprit was the groom. You won't believe what these guests and wedding pros have witnessed men do before and even at their weddings. END
BEGIN HERE "As a former wedding singer, I attended a lot of wedding receptions. But the craziest one had to be when the groom was hitting on me at the reception. He kept winding his way back to the bandstand to chat with me, touch my arm, and ask me to dance. It was beyond awkward." — Marilyn END
BEGIN HERE "The groom called off the wedding a week before — via a phone call to his would-be bride. No sit down chat with her for him. Then, he had his mommy berate all the vendors and give every excuse under the sun why they shouldn't have to pay any of us. Because, you know, Charleston weddings are so not popular and we totally don't get booked a year in advance." — a wedding vendor in Charleston, S.C. END
BEGIN HERE "I was the guest at a wedding a few years ago, in which the ceremony and reception were held at two different venues. The groom did not attend the wedding reception. Instead, he dropped off the bride at the hotel where the reception was being held and drove off. He let her attend the reception alone. She sat at the table alone. There was no first dance. I guess the groom told one of his family members that he didn't like what was being served at the reception, so he decided not to attend. It was very awkward, to say the least!" — Steffanie END
BEGIN HERE "I was working on a very elaborate wedding with a huge installation on a private property. It took a crew of 15 people three days to install a 60-by-90-foot tent and all of the decor inside. But on the Friday before the Saturday wedding, the groom demanded that the tent we erected be taken down and moved 15 feet to the left so that he and his wedding guests to get a better view of his putting green. The crew worked overnight and the next day all of the guests enjoyed a fabulous view." — Lauren, a wedding planner END
BEGIN HERE "The last wedding I attended had a total groomzilla. You could tell he was on edge the entire day, but he totally lost it during his best man's speech. He didn't like what the guy was saying — the best man was making some pretty tame jokes about the couple — so he grabbed the mic and proceeded to give his own spur-of-the-moment speech about how none of could possibly appreciate all the time and money that went into the wedding, and all of the people who were laughing inappropriately at the last toast while they were drinking booze he paid for could go to hell. True story." — Abigail END

And along with settling those last few details — figuring out where to seat your eccentric Uncle Carl, firming up the flowers, deciding on your first dance song — you're likely also making one last push to make sure the body that will be wearing that gorgeous white gown looks as good as it possibly can. You and nearly every other woman with an engagement ring on her finger. In fact, research shows that an overwhelming 91 percent of brides-to-be are anxious about their weight. But from here on out, you won't have to be!  END
BEGIN HERE Whether you want to drop those last few pounds or look more toned — or both — we've got a month's worth of daily tips (none of which require starving yourself or working out nonstop!) that will help you feel stunning and confident when you walk down that aisle. You know where to send the thank-you card. Let's get started! END
BEGIN HERE There are five stages of grief when mourning the loss of one of your favorite celebrity couples: Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and finally acceptance. It's been a year since we lost the adorableness that was Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck and we're still not willing to accept that the pair has split after almost a decade of marriage. In fact, Garner herself seems way more adjusted to her new relationship with her former husband than we are. (Good for her, but what does that say about us right?) The Nine Lives actress opened up the Today show Thursday morning about her marriage and new life with Affleck and her children, and it sounds like Bennifer is just as strong as ever — but not in the way you'd might expect. END
BEGIN HERE When Affleck and Garner announced their separation last year, the world was waiting with bated breath to see if these two crazy kids would be able to work things out. But despite all the reconciliation rumors floating around since the pair was spotted vacationing in Europe this summer with their three children, Garner just cleared the air on the NBC morning show, stating that, no, her and her former beau are not back together romantically, but are still united when it comes to raising their kids. "We are definitely a modern family," Garner explained to Today's Natalie Morales, stating that her and Affleck are now "great friends." END
BEGIN HERE But what about that Euro trip? No, it was not in any way a second honeymoon or an attempt to rekindle their romance, according to Garner. "Ben was working in London on Justice League and I felt like, 'Well, the kids should have that experience,'" the actress shared. "He and I are great friends and we just all went en masse... The kids and I had an amazing time, and he worked hard and got to join us for some." END
BEGIN HERE So while the romantic relationship between Affleck and Garner is still toting a R.I.P. status, Bennifer — as a co-parenting team — is still alive and well for the sake of their little ones. "I want them to see everything's okay," said Garner. "We're doing really well," she confirmed. END
BEGIN HERE That's all we could ask for, right? END
BEGIN HERE  Our Favorite Celebrity Engagement Rings END
BEGIN HERE Congratulations! You're married — now what? While you're still basking in the newlywed glow, many people will begin, almost instantaneously, to ask you what's next. While most of the time these questions are lighthearted and good natured, they can still seem overwhelming. So here's a little bit of guidance on how to respond to help navigate those post-wedding interviews. END
BEGIN HERE   This question can be viewed as 50 percent interest based and 50 percent being a little too nosy for many peoples liking. Traditionally couples wed, then buy a home, then have little ones, usually all in the course of a year — right? Not so much anymore. Every single couple is different, and enjoys a different timeline. It's okay to temper your response based on your relationship with the person that's asking. If it's close family and friends, be open about your situation (they probably already know, anyway). Co-worker or acquaintance? Proceed similarly. Just avoid divulging too much about finances or other personal information, as it's just that — personal. END
BEGIN HERE What a happy weekend for Glee star Lauren Potter — she's going to marry her childhood friend! The actress' boyfriend, Timothy Spear, gave her a promise ring during a picnic the two of them enjoyed in the park on Saturday. END
BEGIN HERE With the ocean as the backdrop, the 26-year-old TV star picnicked in the park in Laguna with her beau, also 26. Once they finished eating, Spear asked her the question that would change both of their lives. "He picked out the ring, made payments on it, and then planned the picnic and the moment to get down on one knee to ask her to promise to be his one-and-only and marry him when they are ready," Potter's mom shared with People. "Then they watched the sunset together." So romantic and sweet; it looks as if Potter was very surprised. END
BEGIN HERE The two have been dating ever since Potter broke up with her last boyfriend — but have known each other since they were infants — both in the same infant stimulation classes at the Children's Center in Riverside, CA. "We've kept in touch over the years, but it wasn't until the kids were reunited while they were both living in Laguna Beach," her mom shared. "When Lauren ended a relationship, Timothy immediately asked her out and they have been together since." END
BEGIN HERE Both Spear and Potter were born with Down Syndrome, and the actress has been a huge advocate for those with special needs. Since she became cheerleader "Becky Jackson" in 2009, she has committed to many philanthropic and charitable activities — including participating on President Obama's Committee for People with Intellectual Disabilities. "Because ofGlee I have been given a chance to pursue another dream of mine — to make the world a more welcoming place for people who are different — especially for people like me who have always been told 'you can't' instead of 'you can.' I want to live in a world where everyone can live, go to school and go to work without having to be afraid," she wrote in an essay on Huffington Post. Isn't that the truth. END
BEGIN HERE While Glee is her most well-known role, Potter has also been a guest star in various award shows, movies, and TV series — including Leader of the Pack, Guest Room, and Teens Wanna Know. She's a true inspiration to anyone who wants to follow their dreams — that's for sure. "When I was young, my dream was to be an actress. Sure people told me I'd never be able to do it, but I replied, 'Just watch me!' Now they are watching me, but this time on the big screen!" END
BEGIN HERE Congrats to the happy couple — Sue Sylvester would be so proud! See below for their adorable photos. END
BEGIN HERE Ahhh, the Olympic games... The place where gold medals are won, athletic records are broken, and where the royals find love. Umm, what was that last one again? As it turns out, the man next in line to snag the Denmark throne, Crown Prince Frederick, met his non-royal wife, Mary, at the 2000 Olympic games in Sydney, Australia. Guess all kinds of fairytales come true at the Olympics! END
BEGIN HERE Before their magical Copenhagen wedding ceremony back in 2004, the prince and princess of Denmark, first crossed paths at the Slip Inn, a modest Australian bar during the Olympic games, People reports. Crown Princess Mary (then known as Mary Donaldson) was an advertising executive, while the Danish prince played the part of just another guy in a bar, introducing himself to Donaldson simply as "Fred." END
BEGIN HERE "The first time we met, we shook hands," the now-princess remembers of that first modest meeting. "I didn't know he was the prince of Denmark. Half an hour later, someone came up to me and said, 'Do you know who these people are?'" Hey, give the girl a break! Can you really blame an Aussie for not being totally up-to-date on Danish royalty? We bet she's read up those history books by now! END
BEGIN HERE Prince and Princess of Denmark END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Getty Images    END
BEGIN HERE For the next three years, the long-distance couple jetted back and forth between their two countries. Eventually Donaldson renounced her Australian citizenship and learned Danish, and the regal pair became engaged, with Frederick presenting his bride with an emerald-cut diamond flanked by two ruby baguettes. They tied the knot on May 14, 2004 at the Copenhagen Cathedral, and in a lace veil and satin grown, commoner Mary Donaldson became Crown Princess Mary. Since then, the royal couple has had four children and have attended almost every summer Olympic Games ever since! END

BEGIN HERE  Kate Middleton Just Re-Wore Something from Her Wedding Day — And Totally Rocked It END
BEGIN HERE We can all tell by looking at Kym Johnson and Robert Herjavec's wedding photos from their Sunday nuptials that these two are a couple built to last, but Johnson revealed that it took her a while to find "the one." She even admitted that she wasn't quite sure if she would ever get married. END
BEGIN HERE The new Mrs. Herjavec, who turns 40 today, told People that she imagined herself getting married in her 30's after getting engaged in her 20's and calling it off because it didn't feel right. Though Dancing With the Stars is what skyrocketed her to fame, she admits that it did but a damper on her love life. END
BEGIN HERE "I was nonstop working," Johnson told People. "It was difficult to be in a relationship. I thought marriage just wasn't for me." END
BEGIN HERE "I think there's a stigma," Johnson continued. "People look at you if you're not married and they think, poor you, but that wasn't the case. I was really happy with my life. Of course I wanted to share my life with someone but I wasn't ready to settle and be with someone just for the sake of being with someone." END
BEGIN HERE She may have had a rocky love life in the past, but Johnson has no doubt that her romance with Herjavec is "the real thing." END
BEGIN HERE "He's the most incredible person," Johnson gushed. "I feel so lucky to go through life with someone who loves me so much. And I'm glad I waited for Mr. Right!" END
BEGIN HERE Johnson and Herjavec met on the set of Dancing With the Stars and were married at the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills last Sunday after about a year of dating. The bride walked down the aisle in a custom Monique Lhuillier ball gown to the tune of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow," and the newlyweds performed two dance numbers for their guests. First, they had a traditional first dance to Etta James' "At Last," followed by a group dance with the bridal party to LunchMoney Lewis' "Bills." It was certainly a night to remember! END
BEGIN HERE You Won't Believe How Kym Johnson and Robert Herjavec Spent the Day After Their Wedding END
BEGIN HERE When it comes to the wedding registry, most couple select everything from the patterns on their fine china to the thread count of their sheets — if you're opting for a sexy registry, that is — together. But a new survey shows that more than a few brides and grooms have added or removed items to their wedding registries on the DL, without their partners being any the wiser. END
BEGIN HERE Moen, a designer of bathroom and kitchen accessories, conducted a survey among 2,026 adults ages 18 and older, asking them for the wackiest things that have happened with their registries, including those changes they've made without their partner's prior approval. As it turns out, 27 percent of the pollsters copped to adding or removing an item from their registries without telling their significant others. That number rises to 34 percent when you consider only the youngest respondents, ages 18 to 34, and drops to just 12 percent for those 45 and older. END
BEGIN HERE So what changes are these brides and grooms making on the sly? "Housewares were a popular behind-the-back addition," Moen reports. In fact, one bride confessed to Moen that she added a china set she adored but that she knew her soon-to-be-spouse despised when he wasn't looking. Another bride had a real problem that her groom had used their registry to snag a gaming system, so she deleted it and added various household decor. One bride simply told Moen that she got rid of "the tacky stuff he picked out," while another admitted she didn't trust her groom's gut, so she took off "some impractical glasses he chose and added some I thought were better." END
BEGIN HERE  The Best Wedding Registry Rewards and Perks END
BEGIN HERE Grooms were guilty of making changes, too, however. "From the male perspective, sporting goods and electronics were prevalent additions," Moen reports. One soon-to-be groom sneaked onto his registry without his future wife's knowledge and added a mini basketball hoop, while another went on and added a gaming console behind his fiancée's back, according to Moen. And a third groom added "a bunch of Blu-ray movies to our registry without permission from my bride," he told Moen. END
BEGIN HERE Of course, odd things worked their way into couples' homes without the couple adding the items to their registries on the DL. According to Moen, 34 percent of couple returned at least six gifts. And when you read about the wacky gifts they received, you'll soon see why. END
BEGIN HERE Brides told Moen they'd received the following odd items as gifts: A casserole dish shaped like a duck, a chia pet, an IOU, ball and chain underwear, and a machete. Yes, you read that right. END
BEGIN HERE "But luckily, it's not all bad," Moen reports. "Couples received plenty of great gifts, too. Many folks stated their spouse was the best present they received, while others raved about generous monetary gifts, fantastic cookware and even a cruise to the Bahamas." END
BEGIN HERE So much happens during those first few months of wedding planning, from choosing a venue to putting together the guest list to designing invitations. And especially when a couple is on a shorter planning timeline, it can feel like decisions need to be made IMMEDIATELY. When it comes to guest lists, there can be a lot more politics and emotions involved than you would expect, making deciding who to send invitations to a drawn out conversation. Can you cut yourself a break by sending a smaller number of save the dates, then finalizing who gets an invitation later? Our experts weigh in. END
BEGIN HERE The great answer is, yes! You can definitely add guests to your invitation list after you've sent out save the dates. This is great if you're still finalizing your guest count, or are trying to figure out if you'll invite second cousins as well as your college soccer team. Simply make a list of guests you 100% know you'll invite (most likely your families and closest friends) and send them a save the date so they can start reserving hotel rooms and booking flights, then spend that extra month or so deciding who else will be getting an invitation. END
BEGIN HERE Worried that guests who didn't get a save the date will think they weren't invited at all? The best way to field questions about your guest list is to respond by saying that you're still finalizing the details. If it's someone who you've decided will definitely, without question be receiving an invitation, you can let them know that they'll be in the mail soon. END
BEGIN HERE The big no-no? Doing the opposite and sending a save the date and not following up with an invitation. If you ask someone to save the date for your wedding, you must send this person an invitation to your wedding, whether you're not as close as you used to be or you are wishing you'd cut the guest list down further.

A friend lives on 30 acres of a former plantation on the water here in Charleston with property that is littered with live oaks. So adios to the marketed formal plantation venues that want $4k and are booked into next year. The Immortal Lobster food truck made unbelievable fresh Maine Lobster rolls. And because I own a mobile bakery and cocktail bar my two custom-built vintage style caravans provided cocktails and desserts from mason jars...No arguments over napkin colors or seating. Just two people in love who dove right in." — Karen END
BEGIN HERE   "I arranged my wedding literally overnight. My fiancé and I were leaving from Baltimore the next morning to fly to the Virgin Islands. My parents, visiting from Iran, were coming with us and I decided to get married to surprise them. We overnighted the marriage license application and filed it with the court the following morning. That afternoon we picked up the license and headed to the beach. I contacted a wedding officiant on the Island who arranged for a photographer, flowers, bamboo arch and local Rastafarian to come cut coconuts for refreshments. My family was completely surprised and thrilled and everything went off without a hitch." — Delara END
BEGIN HERE "Fred and I decided on Friday to get married. Fred's friend Joe was kind enough to offer us use of his lovely Chelsea loft. I went with a girlfriend to Sak's Fifth Avenue and fortunately I was a sample size so got a beautiful sample wedding dress off the rack for under $1,000. We got on separate phones and called all our friends and relatives and asked everyone we cared about to get to that loft on Sunday at 2 PM for our wedding. My girlfriend Mary recommended a playwright who was also a rabbi to do the ceremony, as well as a flutist and cellist. Fred and I ran around Manhattan buying champagne, cheese and crackers. (My parents contributed the cake and chocolate covered strawberries.) My cousin Stewart brought along a photographer as a wedding present. We bought our wedding rings and each wrote our own vows for the special day. It was too late to buy a traditional headpiece so my very creative and quick-thinking fiancé asked the florist who was making my bouquet if he could make something I could wear on my head! It's amazing how much you can accomplish when you're motivated." — Jan END
BEGIN HERE "I was on a trip to Thailand working, and on a lunch break at Chewang Beach (on the island of Koh Samui) my then boyfriend proposed. I enthusiastically accepted, and he had the genius idea of getting married the next day. It was the most romantic place we'd ever been to, and we were travelling with my best friend, so tapped her to officiate, called our parents to tell them the good news, and went to some street vendors to get wedding clothes. My husband had a custom suit made in four hours, ready by midnight! We had a joint bachelor/bachelorette party that night at a beach bar, and the next morning headed to Chewang beach, exchanged vows, and spent the day paddle boarding and eating delicious Thai food. Our friends took photos with their iPhones and a GoPro, and all told I think our wedding was under $200. We then rode our bikes to the highest point in Thailand and hung out with elephants. Getting spontaneously married on a work trip was a 10 - something I highly recommend." — Madeline END

BEGIN HERE Weddings are about more than just your love for one another and the new family you're creating: It's the joining of both of your families, parents and siblings included. And while you absolutely love your fiancé, there's no guarantee you'll be equally enamored with their siblings. So what's a bride to do when she and her sister-in-law just don't get along? Our experts have a few tips. END
BEGIN HERE The good thing is, there's no rule that says you and your sister-in-law have to be the best of friends. Especially if you live far away from your fiancé's family, as long as the two of you can be cordial when you get together for family celebrations and visits, you're golden. Just be friendly, do your best to get to know her, and put a smile on your face. She is his sister, after all! END
BEGIN HERE If it's more than just not getting along, that's when things get sticky. Whether the two of you have had some sort of fight, she doesn't approve of your marriage, or she's jealous, any sort of animosity between you two has the potential to cause rifts with your fiancé, as well. Begin by trying to talk about it. Did one of you offend the other person somehow, and you haven't had a chance to clear the air? Use your upcoming nuptials as a reason to get it all out on the table, and at least try to get to a place where you can tolerate one another. If it's a bigger issue and she really doesn't believe that the two of you should get married, you and your fiancé should discuss how you want to handle it as a couple. Don't ask him to choose between you and his sister — that would be making the problem even worse — but instead ask how he recommends you handle any time you need to all spend together, and find a balance that you are BOTH comfortable with. END
BEGIN HERE No matter the situation, the only behavior and reactions you can control are your own. Be kind and civil, avoid causing drama or bringing up past issues that are already resolved, and know when to excuse yourself for a breath of fresh air. The more you can stay calm, cool, and collected, the easier it will be — and hopefully you'll be able to warm up to one another over the years. END

And she hasn't left his side since. END

When she spotted her Vienna dress on the rack at a store, she admits the glittering material immediately stood out. And with its $100 sale price tag, this bride couldn't resist buying it on the spot. That being said, Bri does admit she wondered about her final choice until the wedding day. "It didn't really feel right until I was walking down the aisle toward Phil," she says. "His eyes lit up like a Christmas tree, so that was when I knew then that I had made a pretty good choice." END

BEGIN HERE Your bridesmaids are supposed to be your support system before and during your wedding day — aside from your fiancé, of course! So the last thing you want to have to deal with is clashing personalities in pastel pink. But what if you just know that one or more of your best gals is likely to be a handful? We asked the pros for their advice on managing your maids and enjoying your big day. END
BEGIN HERE If you're anticipating some drama, no matter how big or small, it's best to communicate early and often, says Megan Velez of DestinationWeddings.com. "Be mindful of your bridesmaids' sensitivities or potential issues in advance — you know them best!" Relationship and etiquette expert and author April Masini agrees that talking through things without pointing fingers is best. "Tell them that you're really stressed because of the conflict and ask if they'd help you with that." This may put them in more of a problem-solving than combative state of mind. END
BEGIN HERE Still, close friends or family members may have their own meltdowns when there's the usual stress or anxiety surrounding the big event. "Remember too, that it's a special day for them as well," says Aviva Samuels of Kiss The Planner. Although it's your wedding, your 'maids are viewing it as their best friend's wedding, older sister's wedding, and so on, and they've likely spent a ton of time and energy (and money) preparing and anticipating it as well. "If you remember that they too are in the spotlight on this special day, then it will be easier to understand how they can be on edge and with this new found empathy it will be much easier to deal with." END
BEGIN HERE Velez recommends having plenty of pre-planned meals and excursions on the agenda so everyone keeps busy, and staying calm in hopes that it will diffuse any tension. Of course, if the wedding party members are prone to clashing with one another, you may want to limit the number of times when they'll be together. Velez says it's fine to connect virtually (group text, anyone?) or to do in-person meetings one-on-one. Your friends will likely jump at the chance to have some alone time with you, and that may be time you can spend working out whatever issues are at play. END
BEGIN HERE  The 49 Mistakes Bridesmaids Always Make END
BEGIN HERE Another great tactic is to give each person in your wedding party a project that doesn't require collaboration with whoever she doesn't mesh well, says Stephanie Aspinwall of Pretty Entertaining. "Emphasize to each 'maid that you're giving her this job because you know she's just the right person to manage it, then let her fly and support her as needed," she says. Masini suggests having one bridesmaid host the grannies and another deal with the florist so they can focus on the task at hand and feel useful. "Building people up often helps keep them from tearing others down," Aspinwall adds. END
BEGIN HERE Looking for one more way to keep everyone happy and reduce any competitiveness? Let your girls choose their own looks, Aspinwall suggests. If you provide them with a color palette and a few style directions, feel free to let them find gowns they love. And hope that any energy that might have gone into feuding will go into finding the perfect dress. END
BEGIN HERE When it comes to the wedding day, build in some buffer and schedule the clashing bridesmaids far apart from one another for hair, makeup, processional order, and formal photos. Play it safe and seat them at different tables, both at the rehearsal dinner and at the wedding reception, if possible. "Give them the opportunity to enjoy some personal space, rather than throwing them together all day long," Aspinwall adds. END
BEGIN HERE If all else fails, never underestimate the value of a sincere heart-to-heart. It's important to acknowledge that your friends aren't getting along but to ask that they get to know each other better and see why you love both of them. "Ask them to give it a chance for your sake," Samuels says. "If you handle it in this way, at the very least there won't be any ill will and they will respect your need for bridesmaid-harmony." END

BEGIN HERE When wedding planning, it's only natural to want to peruse Pinterest for all of the latest trends and wedding décor ideas. But if you're like some brides, this Pinterest addiction can get out of hand — sucking up all your time and taking you away from the wedding tasks that need to get done. Here, therapist Allison Moir-Smith shares how she helped a client with a Pinterest addiction as well as what to do when you realize you have a serious pinning problem. END
BEGIN HERE "Hi, I'm a bride-to-be, and I'm a Pinterest addict." That's how one bride introduced herself to me. Jokingly. But also kind of not joking. END
BEGIN HERE She'd been engaged for four months, and at the very beginning, her behavior was completely normal by today's terms: she went straight to Pinterest. She created boards galore for every possible wedding she could have: City chic, country quaint, vintage, modern, destination — the list goes on! At this stage of her engagement, the world was her wedding oyster, and she had the spectrum of Pinterest boards to prove it. END
BEGIN HERE But she got a bit weirded out when large chunks of times disappeared down the rabbit hole that is Pinterest. In her quest for her Holy Grail of centerpiece designs, she'd look up from her computer and 45 minutes had evaporated. And she still hadn't pinned that perfectly rustic mason jar with precisely styled wildflowers, that impeccably matched her color scheme. "If I just click around enough and spend enough time," she thought, "I absolutely will find my perfect centerpiece." The big question is — did she really need to find her ideal centerpiece on Pinterest? Or could she go on using the information she had in her imagination? There comes a time in each bride's Pinterest journey when you must shift from "everything is possible" to getting actual tasks done. END
BEGIN HERE Making that transition requires you to know what you like, make final decisions, start executing your plans, and get off Pinterest — so you can get your wedding planned. Going cold turkey with Pinterest isn't easy; it's a wonderland of possibility and pretty things. But, the website can be a time suck and avoidance tactic as well. END

With all the dancing Johnson and her now-husband, Shark Tank's Robert Herjavec, did at their California wedding last weekend — they had two "first" dances! — the bride knew she'd have to trade in her big ball gown for something a little more pirouette-friendly. And the unique, sultry frock (see photo below) Johnson chose scored perfect 10 from us! END
BEGIN HERE After a short, five-month engagement, Johnson and Herjavec — who first took to the ballroom together last year as DWTS partners! — hit the dance floor yet again, after tying the knot last Sunday at the Fours Seasons in Beverly Hills, California. For her walk down the aisle, the dancing pro stunned in a strapless Monique Lhuillier ballgown, free of any sparkly embellishment for a look that was clean and classic, but made modern with voluminous tiered skirt. Beyond beautiful yes, but that big ballgown skirt was not exactly conducive for dancing the night away at their star-studded reception. So like the pro she is, Johnson did a quick costume change into a second wedding dress for her post-"I do's" party that was every bit as gorgeous as her first — but a whole lot more daring! END
BEGIN HERE For her reception, the Australian dancer slipped into a custom ensemble featuring a cropped lace bodice with a down-to-there V-neckline, and a sheer tulle skirt. "The costume department made it for me," Johnson explained to People magazine. "I put it on for the dancing!" And it's a good thing she did, considering all the grooving this bride and groom did! END
BEGIN HERE The newlyweds actually performed not one, but two first dances for their guests. According to Us Weekly, their first first dance was to Etta James' "At Last," with the couple doing a classic waltz to the ultra-romantic number. Then, the pair's bridal party also hit the dance floor to join the couple in a group dance to LunchMoney Lewis' "Bills" — a song that's particularly special to the newlyweds. The 2015 hit was actually the first song Herjavec and Johnson ever danced together back during their DWTS days. END

BEGIN HERE Flowers and weddings go hand-in-hand, from bouquets and boutonnieres to centerpieces and cake decorations. But all those blooms can really add up, and the thought of throwing them away when the party is over can be pretty heartbreaking. Instead of putting those flowers in the trash, can your wedding guests take them home as a sweetly-scented souvenir? Our experts weigh in. END
BEGIN HERE Finding something to do with your flowers at the end of the night is a great idea, whether it's donating them to a local senior center or sending them home with your guests. There are, however, a few things you need to keep in mind. END
BEGIN HERE The first is your vases. Chances are you've rented these from your florist, which means unless you want to pay retail price for each and every vessel, you should make sure your guests take the flowers and nothing else. A lot of larger vessels are actually holding flowers tucked into floral foam and sitting in plastic dishes, so that makes removing the flowers easier while allowing guests to leave the vases behind. For smaller centerpieces that are simply arranged in water, consider stocking up on cheap glass or plastic vases, then transferring the flowers out of your florist's vases and into the ones you've purchased so guests can take them home. A dozen $3-$5 glass vases will be much less expensive than the artistic or special-ordered versions your florist is renting to you (which could run $20 a pop or more). END
BEGIN HERE The second is how guests will transport the flowers home. Sure, they could simply tuck the flowers between their feet in the car, but having cardboard boxes and paper towels or newspaper will make it a little easier. Place the vase in the box, surround it with crumpled up paper for cushion, and the flowers will be much more secure in transport. END
BEGIN HERE And of course, you have to get the word out! As the lights come on at the end of the night, ask your planner or catering manager to let guests know that the flowers are available to take home. Make sure they're equipped with extra vases, and ask them to keep an eye on the ones you've rented from your florist to make sure none of his or her vessels walk out the door! END

The pair is set to wed on Monday, which means by now the wedding plans are in place, the guests are on their way, and it's time for the bachelor and bachelorette parties to paint the town. So how's the big day shaping up for the hilarious comedian and his bride-to-be? Well, Hart just spilled about his wedding details — and why The Rock is banned from planning his bachelor party! END
BEGIN HERE "That's right, ladies. I got to put this chocolate in the freezer!" Hart joked about his off-the-market status to Entertainment Tonight. "That's right, it's over. So if you wanted a piece, you better take that and put it in your pocket because you can't get it, because it's happening August eighth. That's right." Think this groom will be doing a stand-up set at the reception? END
BEGIN HERE The nupitals are set to take place in Santa Barbara, California in front of two hundred wedding guests. Hart's eight-year-old son snagged the role as best man, while the bride is pulling double duty as wedding planner. "To be honest with you, I don't know what the hell is going on," Hart said. "I told her to do what you want to do and just come back to me with the finished product." Spoken like a true groom! But his bride-to-be sounds perfectly content playing planner. "He just wants me to be happy, and it will be both of our day," Parrish explained. END
BEGIN HERE But before the "I do's" comes the bachelor party! But while the groom's BFFs typically plan the bash, Hart has banned his Central Intelligence co-star, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, from handling the details. "I can't throw him a bachelor party!"

BEGIN HERE No one wants to seem like they're begging for gifts when they get married, but that doesn't mean having an opportunity to stock (or upgrade!) your home isn't welcome. And etiquette does state that accepting an invitation to a wedding is a nearly-contractual agreement to send a gift in return. So what happens if your wedding date has come and gone, and there are guests you haven't received gifts from? Here's how our experts recommend handling it. END
BEGIN HERE Tradition states that guests have up to a year to send a wedding gift, but etiquette experts agree that wedding gifts should really be sent within a few months of the wedding date, after which they cease to really be gifts for the wedding. So, first things first, wait a month or two before taking any action, because technically the guests in question have some time! END
BEGIN HERE Before you start calling people and asking where your gift is (which would definitely make you look greedy instead of grateful), ask your parents or a mutual friend to subtly do a little digging. Whether it's having your mom excitedly let them know about your new address or a friend bringing it up in the context of the next wedding you're all attending together, this could either be good encouragement for the guest to arrange to have something sent to you, or for the guest to comment on the fact that they haven't received a thank you note — which hopefully will inspire them to ask you if you got their gift so the two of you can figure out what happened to it. END
BEGIN HERE If you never hear anything and more than a few months have passed, you'll unfortunately have to write this off as a loss, as you don't have much recourse here. After all, they did take the time and spend the money to come to your wedding, even if they did come empty-handed. Do your best to forgive and forget, send them a thank you note thanking them for their presence on your big day, and remember that their friendship is more valuable than a picture frame or some new dishes.

BEGIN HERE Weddings are just like the gymnastics portion of the Olympics, right? After months — no, years — of training, planning, sweat, and tears, you get to slip on a sparkly, epically-embellished ensemble for the moment when all eyes are on you. Okay, so we're totally kidding. We know wedding planning is nowhere near as hard as what these Olympic gymnasts do. (Although we'd like to see them deal with your future mother-in-law when she asks for another 10 invites to dole out to her friends...) But there is one thing brides-to-be and the U.S. Olympics gymnastics team has in common: The price of their big day outfit. END
BEGIN HERE As it turns out, the leotards worn by the U.S. gymnasts at the Olympics cost just as much as your wedding dress, with the competition suits toting a hefty $1,200 price tag. But who could blame the team — or brides-to-be! — for stretching their budgets. Whether one is stepping onto the balance beam in Rio de Janeiro with the world watching or down the aisle with their loved ones gazing, looking your best is obviously a must. But just how could the itty bitty bits of fabric gymnasts like Simone Biles and Nastia Liukin don for their Olympic performances cost the same as your big voluminous ball gown with its endless yards of tulle? Well, the same big day dress detail that drives up the price of a wedding dress also adds to the cost of the gymnasts' leotards — bling! END
BEGIN HERE After their first trip to the bridal salon, most brides learn that the sparklier the wedding dress, the bigger the price tag. And the same goes for the gymnastics leotards of the Olympics. According to the New York Times, this year's competition costumes are covered in almost 5,000 Swarovski crystals — that's four times glitzier than those worn by the 2012 U.S. Olympics team, which explains the $1,200 price tag. "It's difficult for me to imagine how we could get more crystals on," said Kelly McKeown, an executive at GK Elite, the design company behind Team USA's looks. "We may have hit peak crystal." END
BEGIN HERE But all that glitz and glam definitely serves a purpose. "You definitely want to feel confident in the way you look," 2008 gold medalist Nastia Liukin told People magazine. "Because when you're on the balance beam, confidence is the most important thing." END

It's one of the most engaging and special moments of the evening. That's why it's usually christened with some bubbly. But if champagne isn't your thing or you're looking to make your wedding as personalized as possible, it's okay to skip the champagne toast. Looking for a champagne alternative?

For wedding planning brides-to-be this means you have one extra day to get everything on your planning to-do list done but for not yet engaged girls this day has a different meaning. According to an old tradition traced back to fifth century Ireland, Leap Day is the day where women can turn the tables and propose (you remember that movie with Amy Adams right?). END
BEGIN HERE This year, David's Bridal teamed up with Brides UK to help a group of modern women pop the question. Eleven women from all over the world enjoyed a day of pampering and were dressed to perfection in special outfits from David's Bridal all in preparation of that perfect moment. These sneaky brides-to-be tricked their partners into thinking they were being filmed as part of a restaurant review for the a hotel's website. END
BEGIN HERE The gorgeous proposers were given the red carpet treatment complete with hair, makeup, and styling. There's really no better way to calm pre-proposal nerves than a day of being treated like royalty. When one bride-to-be popped the question her soon-to-be fiancé immediately thought she was joking. His reaction when he realized she was serious is enough to make you cry. END
BEGIN HERE "You make me a better person and I want to spend the rest of my life with you and have children with you, will you marry me?" one bride-to-be started. Her fiancé obviously said yes (with a proposal speech like that how could you say no?!). While none of the grooms-to-be did the traditional hand-over-mouth surprised face you can tell each one was shocked and excited to become a fiancé. END

BEGIN HERE The list of things you can't control about your wedding is a long one: The weather, whether or not people will dance, if you'll cry when you walk down the aisle... And don't forget traffic! Whether guests are driving themselves or you're providing shuttles to get them to and from the wedding venue, traffic patterns can be unpredictable. What should you do if a traffic jam means a number of your guests are running late? Here's what our experts have to say. END
BEGIN HERE You've spent months finalizing the minute-by-minute timeline of your wedding day, have looked into every local festival, parade, sporting event, and holiday, and have accounted for as many factors as possible. But once your wedding day comes, it's all out of your hands. If an accident, traffic jam, or unexpected weather cause delays for your guests, it can put a wrinkle in your plans, but don't panic — here's how to handle it. END
BEGIN HERE If it's just a few guests, stick to the schedule. Be sure to leave seats open on the outside ends of the back rows of your ceremony so they can slip in once they've arrived, with as little interruption as possible. They might miss your vows, but hopefully they'll make it in time to celebrate with you. END
BEGIN HERE If guests are on shuttles and a shuttle is delayed, have your planner get in touch with the driver to check on the situation. Will they be 15-20 minutes late, but they're moving along slowly? Bump back the ceremony start time by a few minutes. Is the delay due to an unexpected road closure for something like an accident? See if the driver and your planner can figure out an alternate route. If it's a delay that will take longer than 30 minutes, proceed as scheduled — your guests will understand that you aren't able to bump the entire day back by an hour. END
BEGIN HERE If the delayed guests in question are in the wedding party or are VIPs, see how long it will take them to get there, and consider swapping around the schedule. Could you have cocktail hour first, then have the ceremony in an hour or so? It won't be exactly what you've planned, but you'll be able to include them in your ceremony and have that special moment together. END
BEGIN HERE Braxton Henderson had been dating Chalis Sledge for two years when he took a spill on the ice during a Sunday evening skating date — but it was on purpose. Chalis' giggles over his accident soon turned to tears of joy when she realized he'd toppled over with a ring in his pocket, and was now asking for her hand in marriage. "He asked if I knew what was going on," Chalis recalls now, "and I remember I was just overtaken with shock." END
BEGIN HERE Just four months later, the couple tied the knot in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They asked just 30 to join them for their intimate celebration at the Omni William Penn Hotel. "We decided to have a very intimate wedding ceremony that focused on our love and service to God and one another," Chalis explains. But even with their intimate vision, pulling off such a fête in four months was no small feat. "Although it could be overwhelming at times, it was super special planning an intimate wedding and making everything very personal for our guests," says Chalis.

BEGIN HERE Whether you're getting married in your hometown or having a destination wedding, there will be some out-of-town guests traveling to be a part of your big day. It's up to the bride and groom to provide travel information, with accommodation and hotel recommendations, to their guests, well in advance of the actual wedding weekend. END
BEGIN HERE For a hometown wedding, I suggest sending the hotel suggestions, along with the details of any group discounts you've secured, with the save-the-dates. If you're doing a destination wedding, all the travel and accommodations information should be included in a bigger packet that's sent out to all of your guests at least two weeks before the wedding invitations are mailed. The goal is to let your guests do their research and figure out if they can afford to come to your wedding before they're forced to mark "accept" or "decline" on your RSVP card. END
BEGIN HERE Unless you're getting married somewhere that requires you to fill a certain number of rooms as part of your contract, provide your guests with a variety of different price-point options for their accommodations. Some of your guests will only be in town for the one or two nights of your wedding activities, while others may turn the trip to your wedding into their own vacation. How long they can afford to stay may depend on how expensive their accommodations are, so it's better to let people make their own decisions. END
BEGIN HERE  There are plenty of rooms available for $100 or less, if all your guests want is a clean, safe place to stay with absolutely no bells or whistles. Some couples have no desire to spend money on luxurious accommodations when they only plan to be inside them to sleep, and they don't need concierge services. END
BEGIN HERE Also keep in mind that in many wedding destination locations, there are plenty of privately-owned guest houses, villas, and casitas available for rent that cost less than a hotel room when rented for five nights or more. END

BEGIN HERE To get a picture-perfect wedding you'll need just the right location. What better spot to say "I do" than a gorgeous national park with tons of natural beauty to offer? "Many parks offer outdoor locations for weddings with stunning backdrops and unique spaces," says Maggie Lord, founder of Rustic Wedding Chic. But it's not as simple as buying a gown and showing up with everything you need to get married. END
BEGIN HERE "One thing to keep in mind is that many national parks have very strict visitor rules, so make sure you have a clear idea of what you can and cannot do surrounding your wedding," Lord advises. "This includes everything from decorations to music to shutdown time." END
BEGIN HERE Also, while you might expect the event to be less expensive, you'll still most likely need to pay for a permit, and you'll have to bring in all of the rental items like tables, chairs, and linens. Still, it may be worth it to some couples. END

Be aware that park staff needs to approve of any decorations and you can't have more than 100 guests. Then, retreat to the Zion Lodge afterwards where you can rent bikes or take a horseback riding tour as newlyweds. END

BEGIN HERE Michael Phelps is a dad! The Olympic champion, who has medaled a whopping 22 times, welcomed his first child into the world with fiancé Nicole Johnson. Their baby boy was born Thursday, May 5 — and we LOVE this little bundle's unique name. END
BEGIN HERE "Welcome Boomer Robert Phelps into the world!!! Born 5-5-2016 at 7:21 pm !!! Healthy and happy!!! Best feeling I have ever felt in my life!!! @nicole.m.johnson and Boomer both healthy!!!" Phelps posted to Instagram Saturday, sharing a too cute black and white photo of the little family of three, complete with Phelps being shirtless which is, to say the least, quite nice. See the sweet snap of baby Boomer and his parents below. END
BEGIN HERE This isn't the first time Phelps has taken to Instagram to share his exciting life news with his fans and followers. The Olympic medalist originally shared their exciting expectancy news on Instagram in November, alongside his former Miss California fiancé. The sweet photo (above) shows the adoring couple holding up a baby speedo (familiarly labeled MP) in front of something all too familiar to Phelps — a swimming pool! Johnson also shared the news on her personal Instagram account, revealing more than just a look into the newborn's Olympic future. "Today marks 12 weeks and 5 days of us having a little one and yesterday we learned we're having a BOY!" Johnson added. "We couldn't be happier!"  END
BEGIN HERE The couple also announced their engagement on Instagram back in February 2015, posting an elated wintery Instagram photo of the two of them romantically rolling in the snow. Phelps captioned the momentous occasion, "She sad yes," following the couple's rekindled romance after splitting in 2011, and having dated on and off since 2007. END
BEGIN HERE In March, Phelps told Us Weekly, "One of the coolest things about being a father going into Rio is that our firstborn has the chance to see my last race ever," he said. "I think that's something that'll be really special that we'll be able to share stories with him, you know, from the time he gets old enough to realize, and I'm excited to have a lot of photos and just to share the moments and memories with him growing up as a kid."

BEGIN HERE Gordon Ramsay may be known for flinging insults around the kitchen on his reality show, Hell's Kitchen, but this might just be his meanest moment yet. When a patron at his Las Vegas restaurant decided to pop the question to his bride-to-be, the celebrity chef accidentally ruined the proposal as badly as a burnt risotto. END
BEGIN HERE Ramsay recalled the cringe-worthy botched engagement at his recent appearance at the Vegas Uncork'd food and wine festival. "Three weeks ago, one of my maître d's asked me if I would go over to table seven, who were celebrating their engagement," Ramsay explained. "So I said, 'Send two nice glasses of champagne over to them.'" END
BEGIN HERE But that sweet gesture from the famous chef ended up spoiling the surprise! When the champagne arrived I went over to congratulate them — and he hadn't asked her!" Whoops! According to the UK's Telegraph, it turned out that the maître d', whose first language is not English, had muddled the tenses, leading Ramsay to believe that the man had already popped the question. "I was like, how am I going to get out of that?" Ramsay remembers. Well, let's just hope he didn't fling one of his trademark insults at his maître d' for an honest mistake... END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Giphy    END
BEGIN HERE This isn't the first time we've seen celebs get involved in proposal surprises. Early this week, Adele pulled two fans, André Söderberg and Simon Carlsson, up on stage where one of the men got down on one knee and ask for his boyfriend's hand in marriage. And last month, Britney Spears helped pull off a proposal at her meet-and-greet, where the boyfriend of one of her biggest fans popped the question. But we're pretty sure this is the first time a star ruined one! END
BEGIN HERE Well, maybe the to-be-wed couple will get some free reception catering out of Ramsay to make up for his proposal faux-pas. It's worth a shot, right? END
BEGIN HERE So much of a wedding's design and décor revolves around flowers: bouquets, boutonnieres, altars, centerpieces, cake accents — the list goes on and on! And while flowers look absolutely stunning, not everyone is as big a fan of some blooms' heady fragrances. So if you're a bride who's sensitive to smells, what can you do to still get the wedding look you've dreamed of, but avoid the headache? We talked to Julie Robinson, lead designer and owner of Scottsdale's Juliet Le Fleur, about which flowers you should should skip — and which ones would make for equally gorgeous (and less fragrant) alternatives. END
BEGIN HERE  6 Wedding Flower Ideas Your Guests Have Never Seen Before END
BEGIN HERE "If you're sensitive to smells, some more popular blooms that pack a punch when it comes to scent are peonies, garden roses, freesia, tuberose, gardenia, narcissus, and lilies," says Robinson. "The great thing is, there are other flowers that will give you the same shape and texture, but with little to no fragrance." Here are some of her favorite swaps: END
BEGIN HERE  - For a fluffy, full effect similar to peonies, swap them out with hydrangeas.  - If you love the rounded, multi-layered petals of garden roses, opt for ranunculus instead.  - Dreaming of the sculptural bells of freesia? Mini calla lilies will give you a similar shape and size.  - To echo the long lines and small blooms of a tuberose, replace it with a snapdragon.  - An alternative to statuesque blossoms of gardenia is the equally architectural echeveria succulent.  - For a spring wedding, skip the narcissus and instead use tulips.  - Love large trumpeted lily blossoms? Amaryllis will totally capture your heart. END
BEGIN HERE Even better news? Some flowers don't really have any scent at all, which gives you all sorts of additional options to play with. "You can mix in other unscented florals to the blooms above, which will give texture and depth," Robinson says. "We love cymbidium, vanda, and mokara orchids, anemones, dahlias, and proteas, which all have stunning, unique shapes but have little to no fragrance." If you're looking to add even more detail, organic textural accents such as scabiosa, lotus, poppy pods, brunia baubles, and blue thistle will give you extra volume — but again, no headaches! END
BEGIN HERE Mother's Day takes on a whole new meaning once you actually become a mom. This past Sunday, these celebrity first and second-time mothers took to Instagram to share their special family moments with their new babes on the holiday, while some famous doting daddies also posted photos and shout outs to their wives across social media. From Jessica Biel to Chrissy Teigen to Blake Lively to the whole Kardashian klan, this is how some of our favorite stars celebrated the big day. See the sweet photos below! END
BEGIN HERE Above: One of Hollywood's most adorable married pairs, Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel, shared the same photo — a super cute snap of the new mom holding their baby boy, Silas Randall, clad in an adorable "I Love Mom" onesie (which looks very similar to the "I little Silas wore last Father's Day!) — on Instagram to commemorate Mother's Day, but with two very, very different captions. Jessica posted hers with a sweet callout to her mama, as well as all the moms out there: "Happy Mother's Day to you, Mom. I only, just now, understand what you did for me. And to all moms everywhere, I'm having a champagne in your honor. And when I say champagne I mean seltzer water cause mama's gotta do carpool in the am. #momlife" Her other half posted a similar message to his regram, but with a slightly different message: "M.I.L.F.

BEGIN HERE Mom of one with one on the way, Blake Lively, shared this colorful photo of all the beautiful bouquets she was gifted by her hubby, Ryan Reynolds. After tying the knot in September 2012, Blake and Ryan welcomed daughter James, now 16 months old, and are excitedly awaiting baby no. 2's arrival. Blake also took the time to sweetly acknowledge "the two best mama's" she knows, her mother and her sister. END

You hold us up so we can experience the greatest adventures in life," alongside a heartwarming photo of Priscilla holding up the hands a standing baby girl Maxima, 5 months. END
BEGIN HERE New dad Michael Phelps also had some serious celebrating to do on the special holiday. He and his fiancé, Nicole Johnson, welcomed their first child together, baby boy Boomer Robert Phelps, on May 5 — just in time for Mother's Day. The Olympic swimmer shared a touching black and white photo of his soon-to-be wife and their newborn son. "Happy Mother's Day @nicole.m.johnson !!! The first one!! Love you so much!!" he captioned the photo, which appears to be taken at the same time as this adorable pic of the shirtless Olympian and his newborn baby. END
BEGIN HERE The ever-expanding Kardashian clan celebrated the holiday in style. Kanye West took the cake for most extravagant gift, by surprising his wife, second-time mom Kim Kardashian West, with a symphony in their living room...literally. Kim snapped segments of the private concert while holding daughter North, 2. The couple is also proud parents to infant son Saint, born this past December. END
BEGIN HERE Newly engaged brother Rob shared special shout-outs to his "supermom" sisters, and paid a special tribute to his pregnant fiancé Blac Chyna by posting a cozy photo of the couple captioned, "And last but not least, happy mamas day to this beautiful Mama. I fell in Love with her immediately because of how great of a mom she is and now I'm looking forward to starting a family with her! Thank you Chy for everything you do for me," complete with a bride emoji. Chyna, who is also mom to son King, 3, and Kardashian announced just this week they were expecting a baby of their own. END
BEGIN HERE This was also Kourtney's first time celebrating the day as a mom of three. She posted a sweet photo of her three beautiful babes Mason, Penelope, and Reign accompanied by her thoughts, "Feeling overwhelmed with love and blessings being able to be mommy to these three angel babies. My favorite role in life so far is being a mommy and getting to see life through their eyes. Happy Mother's Day!" END
BEGIN HERE They say the wedding ceremony is for you and the wedding reception is for your guests, but really, isn't the whole thing about marrying the person you love? And since you're planning this awesome party, you should get to enjoy it together, right? But with relatives and friends traveling from far and wide to see you, there's pressure to make sure to spend time with them, too, so we asked our experts how much time the newlyweds should spend together during their reception. Here's what they had to say. END
BEGIN HERE The short answer is, spend as much time together as possible. This is your day, and it's a monumental one, so take every opportunity to soak it all in. Drink together, eat together, dance together... Spend as much time at one another's side as you possibly can. END
BEGIN HERE But of course, there are other people around! Getting the most enjoyment out of your wedding reception means striking a fine balance between staring at your new spouse and yelling "OMG We did it!", hugging your grandparents and cousins, and getting down on the dance floor with your friends. The best way to do this is to plan your timeline wisely. END
BEGIN HERE If you're having a first look, you're in luck. Taking photos before the ceremony means you'll be able to add all or most of cocktail hour to your available socializing time. Use cocktail hour to make the rounds of family members, particularly older ones who probably won't stay through the reception. If you're not having a first look, consider scheduling a longer cocktail hour, or pop from table to table during the salad course to say hello. (But make sure you ask your coordinator or planner to grab you when dinner is served so the two of you can eat in peace!) END
BEGIN HERE Once the dancing gets going, try to divide your time between rocking out to your favorite tunes from college with your old roommates and twirling around the dance floor to those love songs that now mean so much more with your new husband or wife. Try to slip away for a few minutes to catch your breath, share a drink, and bask in it all. END
BEGIN HERE And don't be afraid to be selfish. Yes, these people came here to celebrate with you, and yes, you should make time to say hi to them and thank them for coming, but they're not the person you just married! As long as you make a point to devote some time to your loved ones, you can spend the rest of the night holding hands with the one you love — no judgement! END
BEGIN HERE  3 Ways to Switch Up Your Wedding Reception Look Without a Wardrobe Change END
BEGIN HERE After all that wedding planning stress, future in-law spats, and vendor contract chaos, a bride could really use a glass of wine (or two... or three). And what's a better place to grab a vintage bottle of red or white than California wine country? And surrounded by those rolling hills, romantic vineyards, and haute-hued sunsets, your imagination is bound to be flowing right along with the rosé. In fact, we're stealing some super chic wedding inspiration from sunny Sonoma, California for an affair basking in warm tones, romantic details, and gorgeous greenery. END
BEGIN HERE With over 400 wineries and swoon-worthy scenery, the chic California countyside sure makes for a luxe locale for a destination wedding. But if you can't get all of your wedding guests to the west coast, just bring Sonoma to your soirée. With the use of soft summertime hues and fantastic florals, a bride can easily give her wedding a California-cool vibe that's wrought with pretty, feminine details. END
BEGIN HERE Start with wedding stationery that exemplifies Sonoma's earthy-elegant vibe. A crisp invite with crawling vines and chic calligraphy does the job and gets your guests ready for your bougie (and boozy!) big day. Outfit your 'maids in glitzy pearl and gold floral crowns to elevate the typically bohemian style into a look that boasts an easy elegance. As for you, an airy chiffon sheath or a wedding dress embellished with Sonoma-inspired florals — very on-trend for Spring 2017 — will have you looking more gorgeous than a vineyard sunset. END
BEGIN HERE Scatter your naturally lush color palette throughout your wedding day décor to keep the vibe romantic and warm. Small bundles of lavender make for sweet and unexpected escort cards, and a ceremony program adorned with forest-green ivy and tied with a creamy ribbon is right on theme. END

BEGIN HERE Kanye West pulled off the mother of all surprises for his wife this Mother's Day, when he shocked Kim Kardashian with an over-the-top gift that would put our Mother's Day bouquets to shame. (Kidding, of course — moms always love a blooming bouquet...) But did you really expect anything less from Kanye, the king of gift-giving? END
BEGIN HERE Kardashian is no stranger to her husband's generous gifts and elaborate surprises. For the reality star's birthday last year, her hubby surprised her with a pregnancy party, complete with fake baby bumps for all of their guests and a preview screening of the then-unreleased Steve Jobs flick. And the year before that, West whisked his bride off to Hawaii for a spur of the moment vacation. And let's not forget his biggest surprise of all — all 15 carats of it! The rapper's proposal to the reality star was filled with half a dozen elaborate surprises, including a rented-out baseball stadium, a 15-carat diamond engagement ring, and the entire Kardashian clan. Kanye is truly a pro at presents, but even so, his Mother's Day gift to Kim still has us swooning. END
BEGIN HERE Today the mother of two woke up to some sweet, sweet music — played by the string orchestra in her living room! For a Mother's Day treat, West arranged for a private concert by an all-female strings ensemble, which Kardashian showed off on her Snapchat earlier today. But that's not all! The sweetest surprise of all, People reports, is that couple's daughter, North West, chose the tunes the orchestra played herself, with songs including Frozen's "Let It Go," and "It's a Hard Knock Life" and "Tomorrow" from Annie. West also gifted his wife some classic Mother's Day blooms — a whole bench's worth, natch. END

BEGIN HERE After going public with her fertility struggles last year, this Mother's Day has been a long time coming for Chrissy Teigen and we couldn't be happier for the first-time mom. Just last month, the model gave birth to a little girl that her and her hubby dubbed Luna Simone Stephens, making this the first holiday they spent as family of three. Therefore, Legend seemed determined to make Mother's Day extra special for his beautiful bride with an ultra-sweet social media post, praising his wife. END
BEGIN HERE The Grammy-winning singer gave us a little glimpse inside the home life of his little family today, sharing photos of Teigen and their daughter, Luna, on Instagram. The first too-cute pic featured the couple's little one, outfitted in a onesie that read "Happy First Mother's Day!" We can't even with the cuteness... END

BEGIN HERE You can never get enough of a good thing, right? It turns out that sentiment might be wrong when it comes to sex. END
BEGIN HERE Of course, there's the physical side of having too much sex: As Kat Van Kirk, certified sex therapist and author of The Married Sex Solution: A Realistic Guide to Saving Your Sex Life, explains, one or both partners can experience rashes, irritation, or even genital micro-tears (ouch!) as a result of too much getting down and not enough lubrication. END
BEGIN HERE Plus, if your partner's sex drive outmatches yours, Van Kirk says, appeasing his or her appetite can feel like too much sex. "One or more partners may feel overwhelmed by the expectation to perform sexually more than the other," she explains, "and this can cause withdrawal and resentment." END
BEGIN HERE Then, there's the idea that if you're having sex like bunnies, you might not be doing, well, anything else. Says Madeleine Castellanos, M.D., sex expert and author of Wanting to Want: What Kills Your Sex Life and How to Keep It Alive, "if stuff is not getting done — like cleaning the house, going to work, or taking care of your basic needs — in order to have sex, then it's probably too much sex." END
BEGIN HERE And if the thing you're not doing is working on your relationship, subbing in makeup sex for the tough talks you should be having, then you might be getting it on too often. "Using sex as a way to resolve problems in the relationship in lieu of talking about them might be a way that a couple uses sex to avoid the actual work of the relationship," says Castellanos. END
BEGIN HERE  5 Ways to Boost Your Body Confidence For Better Sex END
BEGIN HERE Finally, while "sex is a source of pleasure and vitality and it's natural to have a strong drive for it, if you find that you look for sex compulsively, you may be using sex as an outlet for something else," warns Castellanos. END
BEGIN HERE But with all those big maybes out of the way, our experts say, it's not very likely anyone's having too much sex. For the most part, partners don't want to get down all the time — and even if they do, their schedules don't allow it. "When it comes to the frequency of sex, each person has their preference, which is then limited by their schedule, their sleep pattern, and of course, their partner's availability," Castellanos says. END
BEGIN HERE Over time, a couple finds their sweet spot and has sex a comfortable amount for them, whatever that may be. "The majority of people find that this falls somewhere between one to two times per week," Castellanos says, "and this frequency is usually higher during the first couple of years of a relationship." END
BEGIN HERE As time goes on, you may actually see a dip in your sex schedule, Castellanos says. "It's very realistic that couples cut down their frequency of sex after the first few years, partly because of a drop in dopamine, and partly because of their routine," she explains. But over the course of your relationship, that's OK, Van Kirk says. "Couples will find their own ebb and flow. There will be times of more sex and times of less. The most important thing is to stay connected and communicate so that you can weather and enjoy wherever you are on the spectrum." END
BEGIN HERE Will Khloé Kardashian be walking down the aisle for the second time — and with the same man? Well, after a recent episode of the cult-hit Keeping Up With the Kardashians aired, it's starting to look like Khloé is opening up to the idea of re-marrying husband Lamar Odom. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Giphy    END
BEGIN HERE On the 'sode, Kris Jenner notes that her good friend, actress Melanie Griffith, had married her ex-hubby Don Johnson two times, and of course Khloé had something witty to say in response. She snapped back, "If you're lucky that could be you Lamar. If you're lucky." To which he replied, "I'll say my prayers." END
BEGIN HERE Back in December of 2013, the KUWTK star filed for divorce after four years of marriage (and consequently shattered the nation's belief in true love). But after Odom overdosed on drugs in a Nevada brothel and was found unconscious in his room, Khloé withdrew her pending divorce motion to make medical decisions for him while he was in a coma. Now that's true love. After this very scary — and very REAL brush with death, it seems as though the couple is starting to get close again. END
BEGIN HERE Kris, probably a little exhausted from all of the nuptials she's witnessed in her family, asked in the episode, "If you guys ever got married, could we just skip the wedding part?" Surprisingly, Odom replied with a curt, "no," while Khloé was more relaxed about the topic saying, "Oh, I was gonna say sure. But we're definitely getting out of this marriage because it's been a little tainted...We need to cut our ties and we can figure it back out," to which Odom agreed. END
BEGIN HERE Soo they're going to get divorced and then maybe married again?! Ugh, the suspense is killing us. Whatever ends up happening between the two, it's worth noting that Odom credits all of his recovery to Khloé. And when Kourtney asked the ex-NBA player if he had a new outlook on life after his near-death experience at the end of the episode, he responded with a short but powerful "yeah." END

Besides the mentions and adorable "I love yous" evidenced in her award acceptance speeches (where he mouths 'I love you back' — swoon!), she recently shared at the SAG Awards, "He's the other half of the equation — how can you explain the support?

BEGIN HERE You've dotted your i's and crossed your t's when it comes to Plan A. But if you've been so consumed with how your big day is supposed to go that you haven't developed a plan b for every unexpected scenario, you could be headed for trouble. END
BEGIN HERE Says Victoria Canada, owner of Victoria Canada Weddings + Events in Phoenix, "your back up plan should be organized and thought out before the wedding day. My motto is 'be a girl scout,' and know your options. This will take out the stress out of making a fast decision if you had to imagine and process it prior to the wedding." And to get you started, here are five plan b's every bride should have. END
BEGIN HERE   If you've got every minute of your day down scheduled down to the very last second, what happens if, say, your best friends hit a traffic jam? Says Canada, "You want to take some time to have a cushion in your itinerary, because this is not the day to assume that your family and bridal party will be right on time for photos." END
BEGIN HERE So, she advises, tell yourself that if you must wait on your bridal party, "[you'll] have some cold drinks, cards, and a jam box to help pass the time," she says. Plus, it's smart to know your audience, and advise them of your timetable accordingly. "If your groom is not the most timely, you need to give him some wiggle room for his arrival," Canada says. "This will alleviate stress for you and the other vendors." END
BEGIN HERE If his recent throwback Thursday social media photos are any indication, after all of these years, Justin Bieber is still quite determined to make his ex-love Selena Gomez "One Less Lonely Girl." But Gomez seems quite content conquering the world all on her own, thank you very much. And if you had any doubts about a romance rekindling, Gomez just totally crumpled them — literally. During the second official show of her Revival World Tour, the sultry singer took the stage in Fresno, California, where one fan begged her to "Marry Justin Please." And Gomez's subsequent response shows us that she's definitely closed the door on her "Same Old Love." END
BEGIN HERE Okay, we'll admit it: We've kind of silently (and not-so-silently) been rooting for the star-crossed lovers of Hollywood, Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, to fall back in love, get engaged, and eventually tie the knot. It may have been Justin's too-cute TBT's of him and his ex embracing, or Selena showing up to support Bieber at a performance earlier this year, but we've always been carrying a torch for the two... that has now totally been extinguished. We may have already had the dress, the décor, and the cake picked out years ago (and even kept 'em on file after their 2013 breakup), but the romance between Gomez and her Grammy-winning ex-sweetheart is officially dead, buried, and crumpled in a pile at the foot of a concert stadium stage in Fresno. END
BEGIN HERE At a weekend gig, the "Hands to Myself" singer had trouble doing just that when she spotted a fan in the crowd, holding up a "Marry Justin Please" sign. Pausing mid-concert, Gomez went to the edge of the stage, where she motioned for the hardcore Jelena-fan to pass up the offending sign — and then crumpled it up and tossed it aside! (Right along with our and Bieber's hearts...) END
BEGIN HERE  Selena Gomez Is Going to Be the Maid of Honor at Her BFF's Wedding END
BEGIN HERE In case you were wondering, the fan took it all in stride. "It wasn't meant to be mean," she told E! News. "She put on a great show." Maybe this means people will finally get over those rekindling rumors? Despite Bieber's TBT becoming the most liked photo in Instagram's history, it sounds like Gomez is definitely over them, herself. "I've been dating," the songstress recently shared with Marie Claire. "I've been having the best time." END
BEGIN HERE The only thing is... Who's going to tell Justin? END
BEGIN HERE Wedding dress codes can be a tough nut to crack. What does relaxed cocktail attire, formal morning attire, or boho chic mean, anyway? But the one thing you'd think most guests would know is to never wear white to a wedding (unless, of course, the bride tells you to!). Of course, there's an exception to every rule. So what's a bride to do when a guest shows up in white? Our experts weigh in. END
BEGIN HERE There's not a whole lot you can do when someone arrives at your wedding in a white dress, so the first thing to do is just accept it as fact. Sure, they might be wearing white, but you're the one in a wedding gown, walking down the aisle, and cutting the cake! END
BEGIN HERE Do your best to prevent snide remarks (or an altercation!) by advising your mom and bridesmaids to do the same. Chances are everyone will notice that the lady in question is wearing ivory, so if you're cool about it — and encourage your entourage to be, as well — hopefully your guests will follow suit. Can you prevent the side-eye and hushed comments? No. But put a smile on your face, give her a big hug, and hope that she'll wise up before the next wedding she goes to. END
BEGIN HERE In the (incredibly unlikely) chance that someone shows up in what might be considered a wedding dress — as opposed to a Little White Dress or a cream pantsuit — you may want to say something, but save it until after the wedding is over. Let her know that you were hurt that she showed up in an outfit that distracted from the fact that the day was about you and your new spouse. Hopefully she'll be incredibly apologetic, and tuck that dress into the back of her closet. END

BEGIN HERE Laurie's law school friend didn't let nearly 100 miles stop her from setting Laurie up with a college pal. "Blake lived in Norfolk and I lived in Richmond," says Laurie (a 90-mile drive!), "but my friend insisted we meet. I'm so glad she did!" Their first lunch date turned into seven hours wandering around Richmond, and the two were instantly smitten. A year of weekend visits followed, until Blake finally joined Laurie in Richmond in October of 2013. A few short months later, after a New Year's Eve dinner downtown, the pair returned home to find that their apartment was filled with candles and flowers, and when Laurie turned around to see what was up, Blake was down on one knee. "He'd conspired with my family to set everything up while we were at dinner. It was perfect!" she says. END
BEGIN HERE The duo spent the next 16 months planning a spring wedding in Virginia, choosing Laurie's father's home as the perfect venue for their April 18, 2015, wedding with 125 guests. "We wanted the spot where we got married to be somewhere personal and meaningful, and a place we could visit again and again," the bride explains. They made the most of their longer planning schedule, settling on a playful garden party theme with just as many paper flowers as there were real ones (a DIY project Laurie tackled with her family and friends).

"It was a dress my mom and aunt had chosen for me, and it just felt right — but I second-guessed myself and didn't buy it!" Laurie says. Later that week, she and mom passed the bridal salon again, and the dress was on prominent display in the window. "We knew it was a sign and went back to try the dress on one more time.

All those little wedding homework items you thought you could put off until later — because surely you would have some free time — will come back to bite you when you've crossed that 60-day out mark before your big day. END
BEGIN HERE Even when you hire professionals to execute every aspect of your wedding day, there's still some homework brides and grooms should not ignore. There are some things that only the couple can choose. END
BEGIN HERE Brides and grooms who put off the wedding homework get hammered trying to get it all done at the last minute, while doing the regular wedding tasks that come at that time as well. Guests who haven't RSVP'd must be tracked down once the deadline has passed. Gifts, arriving daily, must be acknowledged with a personal thank-you note. Dress fittings, shoe shopping, practice hair and makeup appointments, etc. all suck up time. END

BEGIN HERE   Most couples who postpone planning the honeymoon are doing so because they don't know how much money they'll have left after they've paid for the wedding. If they know it may be too tight from the outset, better to consider doing a "mini-moon" for a few days after the wedding, and put off the real honeymoon until they have the money and time to do it. Those who rush to plan at the last minute often spend more than necessary and don't get everything they want. END

BEGIN HERE Once you've finalized the guest list and sent out the wedding invitations, the next big thing is to track RSVPs. After all, you want to know how many people are coming to your wedding! Now that your invites are in the mail, how much time should you give your guests to reply? And how far in advance of your wedding date should you set the RSVP deadline? Here's what our experts have to say. END
BEGIN HERE The general rule of thumb is to give guests four weeks to receive your invitation and send back their RSVP cards, with the RSVP deadline falling three to four weeks before your wedding date. However the timing can change depending on the type of wedding you're having. END
BEGIN HERE For a local wedding with most guests living in the area, invitations should be mailed around 8 weeks before your wedding date. Most caterers need a final headcount 10 days to two weeks before your event, so set the RSVP deadline to be three weeks before your wedding day — this will give your guests just over four weeks to respond once they've received the invitation. The additional week allows time for stragglers to get their cards in the mail, and also gives you a few days to follow up with guests you haven't heard from. END
BEGIN HERE For a destination wedding, you should send your invitations 12 weeks in advance, giving guests ample time to make travel plans if they didn't when they first received your save the date. Again, give guests around four weeks to check their calendars, make arrangements, and send back their RSVP cards. Accounting for the time it takes the post office to deliver your invitations, the RSVP deadline should be approximately seven weeks in advance of your wedding date. You'll have plenty of buffer time to make sure every guest is accounted for, as well as get a sense of when people will be arriving and departing so you can plan pre- and post-wedding events accordingly.

The actress has been spotted as of late with some new bling on her left ring finger and that undeniable in-love glow. Is there something you're not telling us, Vanessa? END
BEGIN HERE The Grease: Live! actress has been dating boyfriend Austin Butler since 2011 and they aren't shy about flaunting their romance. (In fact, their puppy love lead the couple to being charged with a $1,000 fine after they carved a heart bearing their names into a rock in the Coconino National Forest earlier this year, but let's just let bygones be bygones...) Butler even opened up to Entertainment Tonight about what makes their relationship tick. "It's important to put that other person first," the actor shared. "If you're constantly looking for ways that you can make them happy, and they're constantly looking for ways that they can make you happy, then you kind of lift each other up as much as possible and you can't go wrong."

BEGIN HERE Summertime brides, listen up! When planning a beach wedding or seaside soirée, you might come to find that some of the sandy shore wedding décor out there could come off, well, a little cheesy... But have no fear because BRIDES is here and we're stealing some big day inspiration from one of the swankiest nautical towns of all — Martha's Vineyard — for a beachy-inspired big day that's chic and never cliché. END
BEGIN HERE Hop on the (metaphorical) ferry and meet us on Martha's Vineyard, a Massachusetts island just south of Cape Cod. The classic coastal town often plays host to the celebrity set and political elite — the Kennedy clan, the Clintons, and the Obamas have all previously summered in the sleepy seaside town — and boasts enough nautical details and inspiring ideas to make any beachy bride start feeling that summer heat. END
BEGIN HERE Start with a clean and crisp invite to call your wedding guests to the sandy shores — an alfresco seaside wedding locale is just a given, isn't it? Next up is bridal party attire. Dress up your 'maids in easy breezy frocks that sport some pretty preppy stripes. A loose shift silhouette will also keep your girls cool in the summer sun. As for your own wedding day look, opt for a pair of bridal shoes that also tote a similarly nautical vibe. We're obsessing over these Banana Republic pumps. END
BEGIN HERE Navigating family dynamics is rarely fun. But add a stepmother into the mix — even a loving, supportive, couldn't-fit-better-into-your-family one — and you could have a real headache on your hands when it comes to wedding planning. Why? Because you'll likely want to give a nod to both women at your wedding without offending the mother who birthed and raised you. END
BEGIN HERE "When you honor your stepmom at your wedding, your goal is to make your stepmother feel included without hurting your mom's feelings in the process," says Jaclyn Fisher, owner of Philadelphia-based Two Little Birds Planning. "You want your mom to feel like her role as mother of the bride or groom is special and solely hers, and you don't want your mom to feel like your stepmom is replacing her or taking on roles that traditionally belong to the mother." END
BEGIN HERE John Duffy, Ph.D., licensed clinical psychologist and author of The Available Parent, says honoring your stepmother at your wedding is a delicate balancing act. In fact, over-attending to your stepmother can make your mother feel like she's been pushed out of the spotlight. "She can feel as if the attention due her is somehow being divided," Duffy explains, "and left unaddressed, this can be hurtful, and can fester and have a deeply negative impact on the proceedings." END
BEGIN HERE But you can toe the line — and sidestep any hurt feelings — between these two parents with this expert advice. END
BEGIN HERE   Says Fisher, "If you and your new husband plan on giving any sort of welcome or toast where you thank your family, don't forget to mention your stepparents." While you may be nervous to give her a shout-out, Fisher says, this move "shouldn't upset your mom since you're thanking all family and your stepmom is your family too." END

BEGIN HERE Deciding who makes the guest list is no easy thing (seriously, we don't envy you). But making an already tough task even more difficult, says Sarah Glick, wedding planner at Brilliant Event Planning in New York City, "is the unspoken social expectation that anyone and everyone you interact with on a daily basis needs to be invited — read: your boss, your coworkers, the dog walker." She's here to tell you that's not the case, and give you five guests you can strike from your list, stat. END
BEGIN HERE   Your Great Aunt Sally, sweet as she may be, doesn't have to make your guest list. "Everyone has distant family that they see only when there is a wedding or a funeral, if you even see them then," says Glick, "and there seems to be an unspoken rule that all family gets invited, regardless of how close you are to them. But while this might have worked well a century ago when people lived closer to their extended families, it doesn't make sense now. People often live far away from cousins and other extended family and have little interaction, if any at all. If you only see them for a reunion-style event, you don't need to invite them." END
BEGIN HERE Finding the wedding dress of your dreams is a moment that you'll never forget. You can call it love at first sight, or fashion luck, but either way, getting your hands on THE dress is reason to celebrate.

In order to dress to impress on your wedding day, and feel good enough in that dress to dance the night away, here are seven ways to break your gown in before it's time to wow the crowd when you walk down the aisle in it.

BEGIN HERE Former Bachelor contestant Ashley Spivey married her fiancé, Steven Hunsberger on Saturday, May 14 and no, the beautiful bride did not carry a bouquet of red roses down the aisle. But who needs a rose from Brad Womack (Spivey appeared on season 15 of the series with the Bachelor bar owner), when you've got a love like this? Spivey and her new hubby looked simply head over heels at their North Carolina nuptials, and we couldn't be happier for this perfect pair. END
BEGIN HERE "Marrying this babe today!" Spivey wrote on social media on the big day, for which she wore a simple and sleek mermaid-cut wedding dress. Meanwhile, Hunsberger donned a light grey suit for their walk down the aisle at Wilmington, North Carolina's Airlie Gardens. And it was a true garden party with boutonnieres of bay leaf and clean white ranunculus, an alfresco dance floor surrounded by greenery and bathed in sunlight, and fresh signature cocktails (named after the bride and groom, natch). END
BEGIN HERE There was one slight nod to Spivey's Bachelor days, however. The newlyweds had a photo stand-in set up on the lawn for some wedding reception fun, featuring cut-outs of the bride and groom. Hunsberger had his favorite beverage in hand, while the bride toted a single red rose. Too perfect! END
BEGIN HERE Best of all? The couple, who met in a bar back in 2011 soon after Spivey's reality show stint, shared their love story on their wedding website. "Once upon a time, Ashley decided to go on a reality show that most men don't watch," they began. "Luckily for her, Steve loved watching The Bachelor and he decided that Ashley was his favorite and she definitely shouldn't have been sent home on that two-on-one date. A couple of months later, Steve saw Ashley at Brother Jimmy's and he decided to buy her a shot." And the rest, as they say, is history! END
BEGIN HERE And as far as the guest list was concerned, it doesn't look like Spivey's good old Bachelor beau Brad showed up. Although he did RSVP... In the form of a sneaky someone making a pretty hilarious joke, that is! END
BEGIN HERE Check out the photos from her stunning nuptials below. END
BEGIN HERE  The Bachelor's Ben Higgins and Lauren Bushnell Are Already Talking Kids! END
BEGIN HERE Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton have been dating for less than a year, but it definitely seems like they're on the road to marriage — especially with the latest signs. The former No Doubt lead singer was seen wearing a large diamond ring on that finger while at the Wango Tango music festival in Los Angeles on Saturday, May 14, leading us to ask the question: "Are Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton engaged?" END
BEGIN HERE The diamond pave eternity band that the singer was rocking on Saturday certainly says so. The ring, which contains a row of large diamonds that encapsulate her left ring finger, is pretty distracting, especially when it comes to that finger — which has been pretty bare since her divorce from Gavin Rossdale. Even though Stefani and Shelton have attempted to keep their budding romance on the down low, it's been pretty hard to stay hush hush, being co-stars and all. The Voice castmates-turned-lovebirds announced in November that they were officially dating. END
BEGIN HERE Since then, the two have been seen displaying lots of PDA — with Gwen, 46, even catching the bride's bouquet at a wedding they went to together. Most recently, however, the couple performed a duet on The Voice that garnered tons of attention and had everybody swooning over their chemistry (video below). END
BEGIN HERE "When they were introduced to the stage, Blake gently touched her lower back, helping her up the stairs," an insider shared with People. "The moment he saw her, he couldn't help but smile. The two shared plenty of sweet, intimate moments during their performance, barely breaking eye contact. When it came to singing, you could tell they were very much in the moment. Once the song finished, Blake embraced Gwen with a hug and a long kiss on the forehead." END
BEGIN HERE It's clear the lyrics have a lot more behind them than just surface-level words. Gwen sings, I never ever meant to get so into you — thought I was using you just to get me through. You know I'm broken I don't trust anyone, last thing I needed was to fall in love. You got me thinking I've got some hope — there is nobody else I want to get to know...but I'm so scared I don't know what to do. How did you get me so into you? Underlying meaning much? END
BEGIN HERE The 39-year-old country star, who split from ex-wife Miranda Lambert last year, explained how the song came to be, saying, "Originally, when I started the song, I was just, I was only trying to impress her, you know, just trying to write her a song to get her excited about me, and I sent her the song half-finished and she wrote the other half of the song, so it's such a 50/50 emotionally-invested thing." END
BEGIN HERE Rumors about the two performers tying that knot have been swirling for a while now, but we're hoping this ring is the real deal. Since Shelton has been hanging with Stefani's three boys (and the five have been seen having the time of their lives), it's obvious that he'd be a perfect fit as stepdad and hubby. Regardless of their current marital status and wedding plans, it's clear the two are totally in love. END

BEGIN HERE How long would you wait for your boyfriend to pop the question? Chances are, your answer is nowhere near the length of time one couple from Leeds in the UK waited to put a ring on it — a whole 44 years long! Colin Dunn, 84, and his beautiful bride Sally Smith, 82, finally tied the knot after putting off their marriage for more than four decades. END
BEGIN HERE The adorable (see photographic proof below) couple met in 1972 when Smith was working behind the bar at a social club who Dunn, a lorry driver, just so happened to visit after he got off of work every week. "Sally used to serve me every weekend when I'd go in after work," Dunn remembers. "We got chatting and she got used to me going in. Eventually, I asked her out." END
BEGIN HERE Smith, with four children of her own from a previous marriage, decided to accept his offer and, as you can tell, the rest is history. But although they were incredibly in love, they didn't go running off to the altar just yet. END
BEGIN HERE "Marriage never entered my head at that point," Dunn admitted to Metro UK. "We were always so busy looking after the children or going on holiday to Blackpool." And even when the kids grew up and left home, the English pair kept putting off their nuptials for another day. "We kept on saying, 'it'll be next year, it'll be next year' — but we were happy as we were," Dunn added. END
BEGIN HERE What ultimately pushed them to say their "I do's" was a series of heartbreak. END
BEGIN HERE "Just before last Christmas I lost my brother Harold and shortly before that I lost my eldest brother, too," Dunn said. "We were going through a bit of trouble and we started thinking what if this happened to one of us? We decided we wanted to be man and wife." END
BEGIN HERE And man and wife they became at St. Mary's Church while 100 of their closest friends and family watched them exchange rings. Just look how adorable they are on the big day! Even with the long wait, Smith couldn't have been more elated. "The day was lovely, even the weather. We had a beautiful cake at the reception but the highlight for me was actually getting married." END
BEGIN HERE Awww. END
BEGIN HERE  One Couple Recreates the Opening Sequence of Up for Their 60th Wedding Anniversary END
BEGIN HERE Dunn admits that relationships take a lot of work, but that it's SO worth it in the end. "It's the little things — if she falls asleep, I wake her up when it's time to go to bed. I make her meals and make her tea. We've had little fall-outs over the years, just like everyone, but we have the same views and we always agree on everything," he gushed. "We have always been happy." END
BEGIN HERE TBH we'd wait 44 years to marry a sweetheart like this, too. Congrats you lovebirds! END
BEGIN HERE While you probably went to both of your parents' weddings when they got remarried, there's a pretty good chance that your stepmom and stepdad have never met. And your stepsiblings? They might not even know you've got stepsiblings on the other side of the family. So if they're all meeting for the first time the weekend of your wedding, you'll likely want to introduce everyone before you head down the aisle. Here's how our experts think you should approach the situation. END
BEGIN HERE The best way to make an introduction between stepfamilies is to plan a casual pre-wedding get-together in a neutral location. If everyone will be in town a few days before, consider inviting them to your favorite local pizza place. Are they up for a little fun? A night at the bowling alley or mini golf course would be a great way to break the ice, especially if some of your stepsiblings are on the younger side. END
BEGIN HERE If they won't be getting into town until the day before your wedding, ask them to arrive at your ceremony rehearsal or rehearsal dinner a little earlier than the rest of the wedding party so you can all meet and mingle without an audience. END
BEGIN HERE Think about things your families have in common, and let them know when you're making introductions that both of your stepbrothers are star soccer players, or that your stepmom and stepdad love the same Netflix crime dramas. Anything that will take them from strangers to acquaintances faster! END
BEGIN HERE And of course, don't force it. While you can try your hardest to make everyone comfortable, you can't force them all to be the best of friends, especially if your parents had a less-than-amicable divorce. So do your best, then focus on the highlight of the weekend: your wedding! END

BEGIN HERE Mariah Carey was never one to go easy on the glitz and glitter, which is why her plans for her upcoming wedding to Australian billionaire James Packer continue to surprise us. The infamous diva has been busy planning her big day while on a world tour and she's rocking a rather relaxed, laissez-faire attitude when it comes to the nuptials. If we were simultaneously planning a wedding and rocking a stage every night, we know we'd be anything but! END
BEGIN HERE The Grammy winner recently hit the red carpet, where people couldn't help but notice her calm, cool, and collected demeanor — an abnormality when it comes to brides-to-be! "This is number three, you know darling," Mariah told to E! News, explaining that she's already donned the white dress twice before. Well, been there, done that, we guess? END
BEGIN HERE The superstar singer has other things on her mind than wedding plans, apparently. The first promo for her new unscripted show, Mariah's World, just premiered and it shows Carey living her completely crazy life as she prepares for her around-the-world concert tour. "I have a tour to do in less than two freaking weeks. Can I please focus on the important things?" she asks in the promo. Guess big day details like bridesmaid bouquets, table settings, and cake tastings will have to take a backseat for now. END
BEGIN HERE Mariah Carey and Tommy Mottola END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Getty Images    END
BEGIN HERE Being on the brink of Carey's third round of "I do's" is bringing to mind her ultra-luxe nuptials of yesteryear. The singer first wed her record producer, Tommy Mottola, back in 1993. The pair tied the knot in an lavish wedding, where Carey donned a princess-worthy ball gown, cathedral-length veil, and a tiara (of course). The couple split in 1998, but that royal bridal look will live on in wedding infamy. END
BEGIN HERE Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Getty Images    END
BEGIN HERE It was another 11 years before Carey tied the knot for the second time, marrying Nick Cannon in the Bahamas in 2008. But one wedding just wasn't enough for the decadent diva. Cannon and Carey returned to the altar several more times throughout their marriage to renew their vows. With "I do" locales everywhere from Disneyland to Paris, each vow renewal was even more luxe than the last! The couple divorced in 2015 with a much-publicized split. END
BEGIN HERE Carey is far from the first bride to scale back on the glitz and glam for their second (or third) wedding. But we say that if you want a big bash, second-time brides should never be afraid to go for it. The "We Belong Together" singer may swear that these "I do's" won't be as over-the-top as her past two soirées, but if we know Carey, there'll definitely be a dash of glitter here or there. This is Mariah Carey, after all! END

BEGIN HERE Frequently, summer weddings are more casual than those held during the colder times of the year. Ceremonies and other wedding activities tend to start earlier to take advantage of the beautiful weather and, the earlier the start time, the higher the temperatures will be, and the less clothing people want to wear. So couples tend to forgo the formal black-tie dress code for their guests in favor of a more laid-back affair. But just because a wedding is informal, doesn't mean guests should forgo the proper etiquette that a wedding entails. With that said, there are some things that should be avoided at summertime weddings that might not come up when the weather is less than temperate. END
BEGIN HERE   The only person wearing a white dress (or an ivory dress, or a pale gold dress, etc.) at a wedding is the bride. (The one exception to the rule is for "White Weddings" where all the guests are asked to wear white.) But this rule gets a little tricky in the summer when so many cute dresses have a lot of white in them. Take a good look at it and think about how you would feel if a guest wore that dress on your wedding day. When in doubt, find something with more color. END

BEGIN HERE Many grooms prefer to stand back and let their brides-to-be do all of the heavy lifting when it comes to wedding planning. Peonies or roses in the bridesmaid bouquets? You handle it, honey. Taper candles or pillars? You choose, babe. Actor Taylor Kinney, however, does have one request when it comes to his upcoming wedding to Lady Gaga. And it's definitely a little cheesy... END
BEGIN HERE We were a little nervous last month that we missed the big day when Gaga and Kinney were spotted with matching rings on their fingers, leading us to believe that the pair hopped on the secret celebrity wedding train. But (thankfully!) the "I dos" are still in the works, and the Chicago Fire actor just shared his one major must-have for the big day. "Just food. Just good food," Kinney told Entertainment Tonight. A very valid request, in our book! (And usually a wedding guest favorite.) But the groom does also have one pretty specific nom in mind. Pizza! (Yes, really!) END
BEGIN HERE While the cheesy meal might sound a little out of the blue when it comes to wedding day food fare, it's really not too unusual when you consider their rumored "I do" destination. The couple is believed to be tying the knot in the Italian countryside, making pizza the perfect reception dinner treat. The nuptials are said to be pretty low key, as well. The superstar singer recently revealed that she is opting for more of a "family-style" wedding that won't be "anything that is worth writing about." Oh, how we disagree... END
BEGIN HERE "Mum is the word," Kinney said, staying tight-lipped on the rest of his and Gaga's big day plans. "I'm pretty quiet and easy. So, I really... I'm not picky." He added that all he really needs is his beautiful bride and his family by his side. Aww! END

BEGIN HERE   Clint says he didn't see his bride on their wedding day until she began walking the winding sidewalk path toward their ceremony overlooking the Pacific Ocean. "I call that moment the Sweet Agony," he says now. "It seems like it took forever for her to get to me. The laws of time and physics don't work the same on your wedding day." When he could gather himself, Clint says, "my first thought was, wow! And the closer she got, the more beautiful she became. Finally, finally, finally, she was standing in front of me, stunningly, overwhelmingly gorgeous. It hit me like a ton of bricks: She was my bride. I cried during the vows." END
BEGIN HERE Weddings bring people together. Case in point Michelle and Mike first met at another couple's nuptials in Los Angeles in October of 2012. Two years later, Mike popped the question and the two began planning their own special celebration. They gave themselves exactly one year to plan their celebration at the Bacara Resort and Spa in Santa Barbara, California, setting the date for May 9, 2015, and invited 500 guests to watch to them say "I do". END
BEGIN HERE "We kept coming back to the phrase 'boho black tie,'" Michelle says of their vision for the wedding. "This meant keeping the wedding as relaxed and intimate as possible with our guest list, but also making sure it would turn into a wild dance party post ceremony." Debbie and Paige from Geller Events understood their aesthetic to a T and helped the bride and groom plan a party in shades of earthy neutrals and moody reds and purples — and one where the bulk of the action would take place after dark. Gia Canali documented every moonlit moment of their blowout bash. Read on to see how everything came together! END

BEGIN HERE When your BFF gets engaged, it's not any ol' announcement — this is an all-hands-on-deck kind of situation. After all, as Irene S. Levine, Ph.D., psychologist, friendship expert, and creator of The Friendship Blog, explains, "you've likely been planning and talking about this day with her for a long time, and fanaticizing about all the details, from the ring to the proposal to the venue. You've seen her relationship blossom with her now-fiancé, and it's likely that you are one of the closest relationships in her life next to him." END
BEGIN HERE   So, you get it. And when your favorite gal pal gets engaged, there are certain things you should do, stat. "In the whirlwind of emotion and congratulations following an engagement, she'll remember the people who went above and beyond — whether it was seeing her on the eve of her engagement, or sending flowers or a congratulatory package of bridal must-haves, such as new bridal magazines or a ring holder for her new engagement ring," says Levine. END
BEGIN HERE First, says Levine, express your happiness for your friend as soon as possible. If she's called you to share the news, squeal your joy through the phone. Or, if you find out on Facebook, be sure to like her post and leave a complimentary comment. END
BEGIN HERE   Then, says Levine, "planning an impromptu get together for close friends following the engagement to celebrate is always a nice gesture, and a way to get the scoop on how and where he proposed to her." A brunch with mimosas might be just what the new bride ordered. If you're looking for specific suggestions on how to celebrate your friend's brand-new engagement, though, Levine also has you covered. Here are five unique ways you can show her just how happy you are for the happy couple. END
BEGIN HERE   Finally, says Levine, don't forget to sit back and listen to your friend when she needs an ear. "Being a sounding board for all of the wedding planning is always helpful," says Levine, who adds that taking her t the spa while you're chatting away doesn't hurt either. END
BEGIN HERE If you were to imagine what living the life of a British royal was like, what would you think of? For us, we imagine the royals spend a lot of time sipping hot tea and playing endless rounds of cricket. Oh, and don't forget the crumpets. But after Prince William visited the Royal Marsden Hospital in London for his opening of a new breast cancer research center, he revealed a side of royal life we didn't deem possible — total normalcy! END
BEGIN HERE Prince William met with women who were benefitting from the research done at the center, including a woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer in March of 2015 named Kathryn England, with whom he just so happened to divulge all of his juicy, family secrets. Ok, it's not that juicy, but it does paint the royal family in a more relatable light. "He said his household is very noisy at the moment," England told People. "He said he was looking at schools. I suppose for George he would be." END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Giphy    END
BEGIN HERE School for George-y already?! It seems like just yesterday that Kate Middleton emerged from the hospital (looking like a flawless angel, obvi) holding the chubby-cheeked prince in her arms. But alas, the almost 3-year-old kiddo is growing up right before our eyes — and only the BEST school will do! His doting parents are already on the lookout a perf pre-prepatory school, even though he won't be attending until September 2017 after he turns four. END
BEGIN HERE According to People, "many royal watchers assume that George will follow in the footsteps of his father and uncle Prince Harry, both of whom attended Wetherby Pre-Prepatory School in London." But the couple may break with tradition and choose instead to send their son to a school closer to their home in Norfolk. END
BEGIN HERE Wherever our favorite royal couple chooses to send little George, we fully support their decision. TBH, we're just hoping to see more pics of the adorable prince with a backpack on and curly blonde hair in his face. Or, you know, a plushy robe? #NeverForget END

BEGIN HERE Oh you fancy, huh? Well, if you have it your way, your wedding will be at least. And no, we're not just talking about the nice tuxes, and ties and designer ball gowns, brides. Unfortunately, a black tie bash doesn't come cheap. It does, however, come with its own set of rules, like 'em or not. From what type of booze is in bad taste to where you shouldn't host your reception, here are nine mistakes you totes don't want to make if you have your heart set on a black tie big day. END
BEGIN HERE   If you're going black tie, you've got to go black tie on everything, food, drinks (a premium bar of course) and transportation included, says Chancey Charm Boston wedding planner Jyl Deering. Obviously, a sit-down dinner with a classy menu is a must. As for transportation, definitely offer valet! "I once worked a black tie wedding where the shuttle service was school buses," tells Deering. "It didn't set the mood right for the guests, and they looked a little funny coming off the buses in gowns. It was also their first impression of the wedding." No bueño! END
BEGIN HERE SPOILER ALERT! Did you miss the big Jane the Virgin season finale? Don't got a step further! As our narrator would say: "OMG! Jane Villanueva is married!" Jane the Virgin finally got her man last night (well sort of), and said her "I dos" to Michael in a perfectly sweet, perfectly hilarious, perfectly telenovela style wedding ceremony. Whether you're #TeamMichael or #TeamRafael, you can't deny the wedding Jane's dad Rogelio organized for his daughter, was pretty much perfect — well, minus the bride and her father running late and arriving there by bus, hey, hijinks always ensue in telenovelas right? Jane's happy ending is still up in the air (is Michael alive? Will she be a virgin forever?), but we couldn't help but find happiness all over this adorable episode. END
BEGIN HERE Here, we're rounding up our top 5 favorite moments from the Jane the Virgin wedding. END
BEGIN HERE   It's no secret that the most important people in Jane's world are her mother and abuela. Jane makes her way down the aisle to marry Michael with both women by her side, and even makes room for her new-found dad Rogelio when he gets to take her hand and be the one to deliver her to Michael (not without a bro hug, of course). END
BEGIN HERE Will Jane get her happy ending? Are you #TeamMichael or #TeamRafael? To be continued... END
BEGIN HERE She's getting married! Becca Tobin, also known as Kitty Wilde on Glee, announced that she's tying the knot with entrepreneurial boyfriend Zach Martin. The actress was all smiles on Instagram as she shared a photo of her and her new fiancé, who were spotted at the Shaky Knees Festival in Atlanta over the weekend. END
BEGIN HERE Tobin, 30, is finally moving on after her ex-boyfriend, Matt Bendik, tragically died in July 2014. "I got engaged!" she announced on her LadyGang podcast with co-hosts Jac Vanek and The Insider's Keltie Knight . "Every single person thought I was kidding. I thought he was kidding when he had the ring in front of my face." Martin is from Atlanta, and the two met through mutual friends, according to ET Online. END
BEGIN HERE The former Glee star shared with her fans that her beau's proposal was very low-key, as she dislikes over-the-top proposals and social media tributes. "Hashtag: so blessed. You'll never see a post where I say 'I'm so lucky to marry my best friend,' any of that garbage. It makes my stomach turn. We don't have an extravagant story. I told him I'd castrate him if he did anything crazy. I really didn't want a thing so it was really perfect for me," she said. END
BEGIN HERE She went on to say that the part of being engaged that she isn't a fan of is the "proposal sharing" piece. "This hurts me so much because this is the part of being engaged that I don't want, so this is painful for me." And even with that bling on her finger, she didn't share any lovey-dovey-proposal-filled caption. END
BEGIN HERE As far as her pals, former Glee co-star Lea Michele has been an integral part of Tobin's recovery over the death of her ex-boyfriend, and the songstress BFFs were recently spotted hanging out at an LA Lakers game — all giggles and selfies (but unfortunately no singing). END

BEGIN HERE Lea Michele, who tragically lost her own longtime love when her Glee costar and IRL boyfriend Cory Monteith died in 2013, hasn't publicly commented on Tobin and Martin's engagement yet, but we're sure she's just as excited. Throughout both of their losses, they have relied on each other, which has helped them both move on — and now, get married! END

BEGIN HERE Her new plus one was actually a recent guest on her podcast as well, in which he sang her praises (and TMI-habits). "Our special guest is a super famous dude named Zach Martin who is crazy enough to date me — and even crazier to come on the LadyGang and answer all your burning questions," she laughed. Her podcast costars warmed Martin up, asking what it's like to date Tobin. His reply? "It's like dating a man. She's like a dude. She farts a lot — a lot of bowel movements." Not what you'd expect from prissy Kitty Wilde, that's for sure. Still, he shared on a serious note that dating Tobin is "really good." END
BEGIN HERE "I've never seen Becca smile so big," Knight said on the podcast. "She must like you." END
BEGIN HERE As far as the ring, we haven't seen an up-close-and-personal shot of it yet, but if you look closely at their Instagram snaps, there's a hint of sparkle that's waiting to make its #ringselfie debut. Even though it's not blasted all over social media for the world to see, it's clear they're pretty excited about spending the rest of their lives together. END

BEGIN HERE In May of 2015, four years after they first met at church, Will surprised Darcie with a trip to Costa Rica to visit his brother and sister-in-law. "I'd convinced myself he wasn't going to propose because I didn't want to be disappointed," Darcie says. But she shouldn't have worried. As they walked along the beach to watch the sunset before dinner, Will's family slowed down, and soon it was just the two of them on a group of huge rocks jutting out into the sea. "When the sun was just right, he got on one knee and asked me to marry him!" she says. They celebrated with champagne on the beach, a dreamy start to an engagement if we've ever heard one. END
BEGIN HERE But they didn't bask in the glow for too long, deciding to get married in just four months! "It's possible!" Darcie swears. They chose the groom's family's farm in Toano, Virginia, as the venue, settling on a romantic and bohemian vibe. "I didn't want anything to feel too 'done,'" explains the bride. With a whirlwind engagement and a stunning venue, the wedding was everything the couple dreamed of. See the gorgeous photos, by Chelsea Diane Photography, below! END
BEGIN HERE Darcie knew she wanted an all-lace wedding dress with straps, and this Martina Liana stunner was the first one she tried on! "I knew it was the one when it was still on the hanger," the bride says. She skipped a veil, opting for a flower crown of white ranunculus, porcelina spray roses, and baby's breath instead. Her bouquet matched the crown, in white and rose hues, and combined roses, waxflower, dahlias, stock, eucalyptus, Italian ruscus, and cedar branches. END
BEGIN HERE William selected the suits that he and his groomsmen wore, choosing for skinny navy designs from ASOS. END
BEGIN HERE "I really wanted the texture of mismatched dresses," says Darcie of her bridesmaids' blush gowns, which combined lace, beading, and more simple fabrics from shops like Anthropologie and Free People. The flower girl coordinated with the bridesmaids in a lace dress and a baby's breath crown, while the ring bearer donned a bowtie and suspenders. END
BEGIN HERE The pair took on a number of DIY projects, with Darcie sourcing and painting their chalkboard signs, and William building the couple's wooden altar, which was decorated with white hydrangea, porcelina spray roses, eucalyptus, blush carnations, and myrtle for the traditional ceremony. "The officiant is a pastor from our church, and our wedding day was so special because we had the people closest to us involved," says the bride. END
BEGIN HERE Even one of the groom's family's horses got in on the portrait action. The wooden fences and sprawling forests in the background created a natural, dramatic, and relaxed scene. END
BEGIN HERE As escort cards, the pair purchased succulents and stuck tags directing guests to their tables directly in the dirt. END
BEGIN HERE Each table was decorated with a slice of wood topped with candles and bud vases full of roses and hydrangeas. A fern was placed over each napkin. END
BEGIN HERE For dinner, guests dined on risotto with spinach and red peppers, a macaroni and cheese bar ("It was a huge hit!" says Darcie), blackened mahi-mahi with mango pico de gallo, and sliced tenderloin on rolls. END
BEGIN HERE For dessert, the pair served a vanilla almond and chocolate cake, decorated with waxflower, Italian ruscus, and baker ferns. END
BEGIN HERE "Our DJ was amazing. We wanted the whole thing to feel like one big party, and there was tons of dancing!" Darcie remembers. END
BEGIN HERE After a Costa Rican engagement, the pair decided to honeymoon in the Dominican Republic. Says Darcie of planning a wedding on such a short timeline, "There will be stressful moments, but remember that it's supposed to be a celebration, so don't get caught up in it!" END

BEGIN HERE You've got a wedding dress, he's got a suit, and your bridesmaids and groomsmen are ready to don their matching attire. But that's not everyone! Chances are you've got siblings or close family members who aren't in the wedding party, some of whom might be participating in your ceremony in one way or another. So while they're ready to follow the dress code, should you pick out something specific for them to wear? Here's what our experts have to say. END
BEGIN HERE If you're having a formal wedding, make sure your siblings' attire is just as dressy as your wedding party's. That means brothers in tuxedos (even if the dress code is black tie optional) and sisters in floor-length gowns. Chances are your moms will be wearing dresses that generally match your color scheme, but it's up to you whether you'd like to extend this to your sisters, as well. (But just imagine how beautiful that color-coordinated photo will look!) END
BEGIN HERE For something a little more casual, think about putting any brothers in suits that coordinate with the groomsmen. That might mean gray suits if the groomsmen are wearing charcoal, or sports coats in a similar shade of navy. To really tie it all together, consider gifting them ties that match or coordinate with your groomsmen's to set them apart from the rest of your guests. Your sisters don't need to wear dresses that match the bridesmaids, but they should definitely fit your dress code to a T. This is the perfect opportunity for a shopping trip! Help them find something they love and feel comfortable with that also fits into your vision. END
BEGIN HERE If the wedding is more casual, or you aren't having a wedding party at all, again, make sure your siblings are really representative of your dress code. END
BEGIN HERE For any siblings who are participating in the ceremony as ushers or readers, details that will illustrate that they're a big part of the celebration are a great idea, whether it's matching ties, boutonnieres, or dresses in a similar hue to the bridesmaids'. END

BEGIN HERE Donna Martin has indeed graduated — into double digit wedding anniversaries! Beverly Hills, 90210 alum Tori Spelling and her husband Dean McDermott are celebrating their 10th anniversary in style, jetting around Europe with their four children in tow, and renewing their love for one another. How, you ask? Well, McDermott popped the "Will you re-marry me?" question in front of the Eiffel Tower during their trip, and they even got a super permanent reminder of their commitment — in the form of matching tattoos! END
BEGIN HERE The reality TV stars have been documenting every moment of their European celebratory getaway with their family, from trips to Versailles to the moment when McDermott got down on bended knee and asked his wife to renew their vows. "A happy girl in Paris!" Spelling captioned an Instagram snapshot. "My one true love asked me to marry him (again) in the city of romance with all my babies! Yes Yes Yes!" But that wasn't the only way the famous pair showed their love. Spelling and her hubby just revealed the new matching tattoos they got to celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary. END
BEGIN HERE The former Beverly Hills, 90210 star headed to the Tin Tin Tattoo Parlor in Paris to get inked with McDermott. In one photo, Spelling is seen lying down with her tattoo artist at work, and looked to be taking it like a champ! END
BEGIN HERE Both the husband and wife ended up with pretty, cursive writing on their biceps that reads, "Tout mon coeur, tout ma vie," which translates to "My whole heart, my whole life." Too sweet! "Happy 10 Year Anniversary to the love of my life," Spelling shared on social media. "I can't wait to marry you all over again! #LoveWins #BestAnniversaryGiftEVR." END
BEGIN HERE Some say that getting inked together is the kiss of relationship death. (Anyone remember Kaley Cuoco's recent cover-up on her wedding date tatt?) But after all this cute couple has overcome (an uber public cheating scandal, reality TV, etc...), we're thinking that their love will stick just as long as their new ink! END

BEGIN HERE When the post-engagement excitement turns into pre-wedding planning mode, one of the first things you'll find yourself on the hunt for is a venue to host your wedding. You may look at hometown options or even far away destination wedding locales that will give your big day a backdrop that looks like it's straight out of a postcard. END
BEGIN HERE Either way, before signing on the dotted line and agreeing to throw the wedding of your dreams at a location that fits your budget, here are the top seven questions to ask the space before saying "I do" to them. END

BEGIN HERE If you're in a relationship, it's pretty much a given that you're going to have to say you're sorry at some point. But not all apologies are created equal. So how do you increase the chances that someone will accept yours? END
BEGIN HERE A new study has delineated six crucial elements that people seek out in others' apologies. Based on 755 people's reactions to different apologetic statements, the researcher found that these are the most important elements of an apology in order. END
BEGIN HERE With all of the rumors swirling about Mariah Carey's upcoming wedding to Australian billionaire James Packer (Are they really tying the knot down under, near Australia's Great Barrier Reef? Is the bride really donning a 14K gold, butterfly-adorned wedding dress?), Mimi is finally setting the record straight when it comes her big day. And of course, we're dying to know the details! END
BEGIN HERE The wildest of the rumors? That Carey is employing a fleet of circus animals to perform at her reception. Lions, tigers, and bears — oh my! See? Told you the rumor was pretty wild... END
BEGIN HERE So what's the verdict? Will Carey's big day be more big top circus? "No, that really made me mad," the superstar singer told Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live. "These people really want to tell me I want endangered animals at my wedding? I mean, I have several dogs," she said, explaining her love for her four-legged friends. END
BEGIN HERE "I'm such an animal lover and such an advocate for animals that I'm like, really, that's what I'm going to do, have like endangered species?" Carey continued. "Should I make coats from them all? What else should we do?" So we're assuming a fur embellished wedding dress is out of the question, then? END
BEGIN HERE Cohen then asked Carey about the issue of their respective ginormous fortunes, and whether they're taking any legal precautions before exchanging vows, E! News reports. "Will there be a prenup?" Andy asked. "You're both very valuable." END
BEGIN HERE "We want prenup. We want prenup," Mariah replied when remembering Kanye West's song lyrics to "Gold Digger." "Look, everybody's valuable." END
BEGIN HERE Another crazy rumor the Grammy winner slayed? That she'll be pulling double duty at her nuptials, as both bride and wedding singer. "Why would you sing at your own wedding," she said to People. "It's obnoxious!" END
BEGIN HERE "Of course I'm not going to perform at my wedding," she later continued to Entertainment Tonight. "I'm not even sure someone is performing. It's more gonna be a small thing. We already did the thing with the ring. So, you know, it's over the top already! It's over the top enough." END
BEGIN HERE Yeah, we'd say a whopping 35 carat diamond engagement ring is pretty over the top, but is really anything too glitzy or too glam for this diva? Guess we'll just have to wait and see! END

BEGIN HERE You're online wedding registry is a work of art, created by logging countless hours deliberating stand mixer colors, china patterns and other SUPER important decisions (okay, relatively speaking), and you're pretty darn proud of it. But, er, has that pride turned into more of an obsession? Are you logging more hours at work on your registry site than you are on actual, well, work. Trust us, you're not alone. Bridal counselor Allison Moir-Smith, who solves family, emotional, and sticky wedding-planning situations at The Bride Whisperer, lends her expert advice for those brides who just can't seem to tear themselves away from their own online registries. END
BEGIN HERE "I'm a pretty serious person, with a serious job as a litigation attorney," Erica told me. "But I'm embarrassed about how much time I'm spending each day tweaking my online wedding registries. An hour? Maybe two? I can't settle on how many sets of china, or how many wine glasses to ask for. I keep changing, tweaking, second-guessing." END
BEGIN HERE "If the partners in my firm found out, they'd totally lose respect for me," she continued. "And frankly, I'm starting to lose respect for myself." My advice to Erica? Stop judging herself, and start digging more deeply into her behaviors. In other words, start looking for the metaphors in her online registry tweaking. END
BEGIN HERE What metaphors await Erica at Crate & Barrel website? Her entire new married life, that's what. Online wedding registries are acts of imagination. You don't yet actually own any of the items you list yet, and you may not receive everything. They live purely in your imagination. END
BEGIN HERE As you tweak the number of place settings on your registry — "Should I ask for 10? Or 12? Or 10? No, 12!" — you're fantasizing into the future about all the holiday meals you'll serve on these very plates, your table filled with family, with you and your husband as the hosts. The first Thanksgiving as newlyweds. Your first holiday with a baby. Your kids getting older (and maybe your as-yet-unborn gangly teenage son accidentally smashing one of your pretty fine-china plates!). END
BEGIN HERE The obsessiveness about the online registry really isn't about the stuff you may or may not acquire — the glassware, the kitchen equipment, the tableware... If you look at what's going on psychologically, all your tweaking's actually helping you slowly wrap your mind and heart around these enormous life changes that are happening to you. END
BEGIN HERE So go ahead: be obsessed with your online wedding registry if you want to be. Just bring an awareness that it's not about scoring awesome stuff. It's about how your imagination's helping you process and prepare for your future. END

BEGIN HERE But, says Aviva Samuels, owner of Kiss the Planner in Palm Beach, Florida, "five, 10 and 25 years from now, the very last thing on your mind will be the weather on your wedding day. You are marrying the love of your life, and that is for a lifetime. In the grand scheme of things, rain is probably the least tragic thing that you will encounter." END

I had never seen my husband without facial hair — until our wedding day as he walked down the aisle towards me. I was shocked and almost didn't recognize him! I took a deep breath and married this 'stranger' anyway. It took a while to get used to his new look, but now we're living happily ever after." — Kristen END

BEGIN HERE   If you love them, wear it! If you don't, don't. After all, just because you may decide to wear one doesn't mean you accept all the history or tradition that comes with it. It's a great finishing piece to your bridal ensemble, and does add a traditional feel to the big day. If it makes sense with the rest of your look, go for it! It is YOUR day, after all, so be true to you. END

On Monday, the Los Angeles-based jeweler posted an up-close-and-personal photo of the four-prong solitaire oval diamond to his Instagram. "HUGE congratulations to my dear friends @brodyjenner and @kaitlynn_carter on their Engagement this week in Bali!" Campbell captioned the photo, which was a split of the engagement ring close-up with a cute couple shot of Jenner and Carter. "I couldn't be happier for you both and was honored to play a small part in your Story. Here's to many years of wedded bliss. Love you both! #engaged." END
BEGIN HERE The couple's jeweler wasn't the only one posting cute pics to Instagram in celebration of the couple's exciting news. The groom-to-be's mom, Linda Thompson, took to the social media site to welcome her future daughter-in-law into the family. "If we look happy it's because we are! CONGRATULATIONS to @brodyjenner & @kaitlynn_carter who got ENGAGED in Nihiwatu! #Family #Love," she wrote on Instagram. END
BEGIN HERE The Hills alum and Carter broke the news of their engagement via Instagram early Friday morning with a semi-steamy photograph. The sweet snap shows the celebrity DJ and his new fianc basking in the sun on vacation with a bikini-clad Carter leaning across her beach towel to kiss Jenner on the cheek. "On May 4th 2016 I got engaged to my lover and best-friend," Jenner captioned the adorable, jealousy-inducing pic, including all the happy marriage emojis possible. "I couldn't be more in love with this woman and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with her." END
BEGIN HERE Jenner, 32, first began dating Carter, 28, in 2014, accordingly to Us Weekly. If you'll remember, their relationship was considered "too new" for Kim Kardashian to offer her stepbrother a plus one to her Italian wedding to Kanye West, resulting in him boycotting the family affair entirely. Jenner, who was previously romantically linked to The Hills leading ladies Lauren Conrad and Kristin Cavallari, has made the distance between him and his step-sisters very clear. END
BEGIN HERE "I don't see them very often," Brody told Yahoo Style of the Kardashian sisters. "I live out in Malibu, they live in Calabasas. To be honest, I don't even really know Kanye that well at all. I've really only met him one time," Brody said. "That's the one thing that people don't really understand is that we live two completely separate lives. And everybody ties us in together as the Kardashians and the Jenners. I mean, [Kris and Caitlyn] got a divorce, so they're not even technically my family anymore." END
BEGIN HERE Regardless of who gets an invite to this newly engaged couple's wedding or not, one thing's for certain — we're sure that enormous engagement ring on Carter's left hand would definitely be Kardashian approved! END
BEGIN HERE With just a few months before her big day, Vanderpump Rules star Katie Maloney and Tom Schwartz's wedding festivities are getting into full swing. But while she's ogling over her engagement ring, planning the big day, and enjoying that engagement-year bliss, one of her co-stars is wearing a engagement ring — without a fiancé! Kristen Doute isn't engaged, but she's been wearing a faux engagement ring. END
BEGIN HERE "Kristen wears a fake engagement ring!" the ladies chorused in unison during an interview with E! News. "Show it! She's wearing it right now. She's practicing." The Pump Rules star bashfully held up her left hand, which has a gold band with (what we're assuming is) a cubic zirconia center stone. END

BEGIN HERE      Photo: E! News    END
BEGIN HERE "You know he's a keeper. I bought it for myself — I just wanted to test it out. It looks good. I just wanted to see — what if I don't like this cut?" Doute responded. She seems totally smitten with her new beau Brian Carter, saying, "everything's great. I have zero complaints." That must be the case, especially if she's sporting a sparkler sans proposal. She went on to share that she and her main squeeze are living together and have a puppy, so it's not thaaat far of a cry to be trying out the engaged look. END
BEGIN HERE As far as the real bride-to-be, Katie Maloney seems pretty relaxed about the whole wedding affair. "I'm getting married this August," she revealed to E! News. "I have a dress. I got the dress before we picked a date. We have a location, we have a date — now we can get into the really fun part of planning of like, you know, colors and who's going to be my bridesmaids and all of that." Yes, you heard correctly. Three months until her big day and she hasn't informed her bridesmaids that they are, in fact, her bridesmaids. END
BEGIN HERE "She hasn't told us that we're [her bridesmaids]," Scheana Shay shared. "We're waiting." But Maloney had a response to her friends' comments. END
BEGIN HERE "I want to tell those that I've chosen before I tell anyone else. I'm not trying to tease and, and be secretive about stuff but it does feel like I want to keep things a little more private until they become more concrete," she said — all while hiding her face with her hands as to not give anything away. END
BEGIN HERE The reality star went on to explain how Schwartz is as a groom in the planning process: on a budget. He wants to save us money, she shared. "He basically said, 'We don't need flowers. We don't need food. Let's just get really good music," she laughed. "That's not really how it works." Oh Schwartz. END
BEGIN HERE No matter where she is in the planning process, it sounds like she has a good head on her shoulders about the whole thing and isn't too worried about much. We can't wait to see how beautiful she looks on the big day — and perhaps see a recap of the bachelor/bachelorette party shenanigans on Vanderpump Rules too. If it's anything like a regular episode, it's sure to be pretty ridiculous. END
BEGIN HERE Sneaky, sneaky! Eva Mendes just sent us all into a tizzy with the news and her and Ryan Gosling have welcomed their second child into the world — two whole weeks ago! We can't believe how these two sleuth stars kept us waiting! Don't they understand how much we adore famous little ones? END
BEGIN HERE Just last month, the news broke that the actress was expecting her second child with Gosling. The pair previously welcomed a baby girl into their family in September of 2014, whom they named Esmeralda Amada. Mendes' first pregnancy was kept just as secretive as her second, with the public only finding out that the couple was expecting during Mendes' third trimester. "Ryan has been taking care of her, picking up food and running errands. He has been very supportive of keeping things a secret," a source close to the twosome shared with People at the time. But this time around, the meant-to-be pair — who who began dating in 2011 when they costarred in the film The Place Beyond the Pines — managed to even keep their little one's birth under wraps! END
BEGIN HERE According to the golden child's birth certificate obtained by TMZ, Mendes and Gosling's baby — another beautiful daughter! — arrived on April 29 at 8:03 A.M., when Gosling (presumably) greeted her with a "Hey, girl." END
BEGIN HERE "They've settled so well into their new family of three," an insider dished to E! News. "Ryan is very hands on and has been taking the baby after the early morning feed so Eva can sleep in a bit. He sings the baby songs — they are both madly in love with this child." END
BEGIN HERE The name of the little one? Amada Lee Gosling. Yes, the first name of Baby No.2 shares the same moniker as the middle name of Baby No.1. But Mendes and Gosling have a good reason for the recycled moniker. "Amada was my grandmother's name," the actress explained back in 2014. "It means 'beloved' in Spanish." END

BEGIN HERE Last Friday, the divorce between the Big Bang Theory actress and the tennis pro became finalized, with a prenuptial agreement the couple had previously signed spelling out the logistics of the split. And while we're still mourning the seemingly-perfect twosome — who tied the knot on New Year's Eve of 2013 with the bride donning a custom petal-hued Vera Wang wedding dress — it sounds like Cuoco has happily moved on and has her sights set on a new definition of happily ever after as unique as that pretty-in-pink bridal gown.

BEGIN HERE "Some people make mistakes," she shared. "And I wouldn't call it a mistake. It's just what happened in my life, and now I'm excited to see what the future holds. But it happened, and now I have to say I'm happier than I've ever been." But she's not only happy, she's in love! END
BEGIN HERE Cuoco has recently been linked to 25-year-old professional equestrian Karl Cook, according to Entertainment Tonight, whom she bonded with over their mutual love of horses."Even when I was going through it, I was like, 'Oh, I'm never gonna love again,' I can't even pretend to say that because it's not me. It's not my heart," Cuoco explained. "I think that the horse connection is special," she said of her new beau. "He's special." END

BEGIN HERE Aww! Here's hoping these two ride off into the sunset together. Fingers (and hoofs) crossed! END
BEGIN HERE Thanks to online wedding registries, buying wedding gifts is easier than ever. You don't even need to set foot in a store if you don't want to! But there's still the question of how much you should spend. We asked our experts to break down what you should pay for a wedding gift, depending on whose wedding it is. END
BEGIN HERE The best way to figure out how much to spend on a wedding gift is to consider both your personal financial situation and how well you know the couple. END
BEGIN HERE If your work friend is getting married or you're young and new to the workforce, $50 is totally reasonable. Consider bumping it up to $75 if you have a standing weekly coffee date or wouldn't hit the office cafeteria without one-another. END
BEGIN HERE Is it a friend or distant relative? Look for a gift in the $75-$125 range, and consider selecting something from the registry that is a little more personal and holds some meaning to your relationship, whether it's wine glasses in honor of that Italian restaurant you love to go to together or a cooler you know they'll take on their camping trips. END
BEGIN HERE If you're attending the wedding of a close friend or relative, you'll probably want to be in the $100 to $200 range. Pick out one of the nicer items on their registry, or swoop in and complete that set of bakeware your friend has been eyeing. Again, sending a gift that has meaning to the two of you, or that you know she's been hoping to receive, is a great way to add extra emotional value. END
BEGIN HERE Of course, if you have the funds, you can always go up in price range. If you want to spring for a bigger gift but can't cover the costs yourself, go in with a friend or two on a group gift to divide the hefty price tag of a stand mixer a few ways. END
BEGIN HERE No matter what you're spending, you'll have the best luck if you purchase early — there will be way more options on the registry so you can either find something in your price range or combine a few lower-priced items to get where you wanted. And of course, don't forget the card! A sweet note of congratulations will be the perfect finishing touch. END
BEGIN HERE  Should Your Wedding Date Bring a Gift? END
BEGIN HERE During their junior year of college at George Washington University, it wasn't quite Meg Cerullo that Erik Heil was after during a party — but he quickly realized he had set his sites on the wrong collegiate. "Erik was hitting on my friend and started talking about basketball," Meg says. "My friend stopped him to say, 'You want this one,' and bodily placed me in front of him. I was on the dance team at GW and performed at all the home basketball games, so I had gotten very involved and interested in all things basketball." Their list of mutual interests only grew and, seven years after their first introduction, Erik surprised Meg with a proposal while she was on vacation with friends in New York City. "I was out to dinner with a friend and we were sitting in an intimate table in the corner. She excused herself to take a call from her boss and when I looked up from my menu, there was Erik, all dressed up in a suit. I didn't realize he was proposing until he dropped to one knee." END
BEGIN HERE Although the couple now calls Washington, D.C., home, they knew they wanted to tie the knot in New England. Meg, a Maine native, and Erik, who hails from Massachusetts, both wanted to get married closer to home and quickly decided on Marianmade Farm in Wiscasset, Maine. The working lavender and flower farm is nestled on the Sheepscot River, making the property a rustic-chic bride's dream. "The goal was to be as laid-back as possible," Meg says of the couple's style, but with the help of Sarah Goodwin at Daisies & Pearls, the bride and groom were able to achieve a pretty and put-together look that still felt relaxed and comfortable. The pair made it official on August 1, 2015, with 94 guests in attendance, including the bride's A-list maid of honor, Anna Kendrick. Read on to see how their day came to life, as photographed by Meredith Perdue. END

BEGIN HERE While she says she was a laid back bride-to-be, Meg admits she didn't love planning her wedding. "It was challenging to do from afar and was so much harder than I anticipated," says the bride. "I swear, without Sarah, the wedding would never have happened. She was immensely helpful with every detail." With the help of their skilled planner, Meg and Erik settled on a gray and sea foam color palette, which paired well with the natural hues on the property rather than overwhelm it. END

BEGIN HERE Meg was every bit the beautiful bride in her strapless Karen Willis Holmes wedding dress, but remembers finding that look took more effort than she anticipated. "It took me a long time. I was never gaga over any one dress," the bride says. "I am not a typical 'girly girl,' I work at a sport agency!" Unfortunately, her sales associate at the first salon she visited didn't understand her aesthetic, and the princess-inspired ball gown he put Meg in was a far cry from what she wanted. After what the bride describes as "many failed attempts" at shopping for her gown, she visited Love Couture Bridal with two of her bridesmaids and was resolved to buy her dress then and there. "Luckily, it was a great experience and it all worked out!" END
BEGIN HERE The ruched bodice and tulle skirt made her dress feel romantic and understated, perfect for Meg's personality and her wedding venue. Her jewelry, however, was as special as could be. Meg's best friend and maid of honor, actress Anna Kendrick, surprised the bride with a full set of Harry Kotlar diamonds on loan from the jeweler. "I wore an incredible pair of earrings, bracelets, and rings for the rehearsal dinner and a different pair of drop earrings and a bracelet for the wedding," she says. "After the ceremony, I added a truly incredible necklace to change up my look for the reception. That's got to be the most incredible 'something borrowed' in history." END

"I wanted the girls to be comfortable in something light that fit the venue," she says. "I fully admit that none of them will ever the wear the dress again, but they looked amazing for the day!" END
BEGIN HERE Erik's groomsmen wore gray blazers, white dress shirts, and blue pants, all purchased at Banana Republic. To coordinate with the groom, each accessorized with the same plaid pocket square. "We wanted them to fit in with the color scheme and remain a bit casual, which is why we decided against suits and ties," says the bride. But if her groom had it his way, their look would have been decidedly different. "Erik wanted ties but no jackets, so I had to remind him this wasn't a middle school dance." END
BEGIN HERE Each 'maid carried a bouquet reminiscent of the bride's, all filled with garden roses, hydrangea, and ranunculus, as well as a few succulents. Erik's groomsmen wore the same boutonniere as the groom. END

BEGIN HERE The ceremony was held on the lawn overlooking the river. There, the couple and their planner had arranged a gorgeous arbor that was decorated with clusters of local flowers and ferns. Benches were set out for guests and shepherds hooks with arrangements of blooms lined the aisle. END
BEGIN HERE Since the bride is particularly close with her brother, she asked him to walk her down the aisle. "My mom and dad walked down together first since I knew my dad and I would get to have the special father-daughter dance," Meg says. "I attribute a lot of my personality to my brother, and having him give me away was one of my favorite parts of the day." One of the couple's favorite details from their wedding was the string quartet that performed during the ceremony and cocktail hour. As Meg made her entrance, the Boston String Quartet played "Drops of Jupiter" by Train. END
BEGIN HERE The bride and groom chose not to write their own vows, but did work together to create a ceremony that felt reflected of who they are as a couple. "We're not religious and it was important to us that there was no spiritual aspect to our ceremony because otherwise it would feel fake to us," Meg says. Erik's childhood friend officiated the ceremony, making it all the more personal. After the newlyweds were pronounced husband and wife, they made their way back down the aisle as the string quartet performed "Marry You" by Bruno Mars. END

A mix of different sea green glass bottles held mixed arrangements of different flowers grown on the farm, including garden roses, sweet peas, dahlias, thistle, and hydrangeas. END
BEGIN HERE Bamboo plates and hand-cut blue linen napkins (another project tackled by the mother of the groom!) made up each casual place setting. The couple decided on a casual — yet delicious! — dinner catered by a variety of different food trucks, including a mobile brick over pizza truck, which served up flatbread pizzas, sliders, meatballs, and toast points, and a lobster roll truck, which dished up three different varieties of the beloved New England sandwich and salads. "It was a great way to get people out of their seats and let everyone pick exactly what they wanted to eat," Meg says. "Everyone was able to move around and mingle." END

BEGIN HERE On top of their delicious dinner offerings, the couple also thought up two unique and delicious signature cocktails: A blueberry mojito and a lavender Collins. "Blueberries are a really big crop in Maine and the wedding was on a lavender farm, so they both felt very appropriate," she says. Needles to say, both cocktails were very popular with the couple's guests. For dessert, the couple skipped cake and brought in an ice cream truck instead. Guests enjoyed gourmet ice cream sandwiches like vanilla ice cream with chocolate chip cookies, peanut butter ice cream with chocolate cookies, and strawberry ice cream with sugar cookies, as well as root beer floats and Italian ice.

But we're thinking her wedding day might just have stolen that title! END
BEGIN HERE On Friday May 6, Doubleday and her now-hubby headed to the Ventana Inn in Big Sur, California to tie the knot, and they certainly didn't let the gloomy weather rain on their parade. Despite the drizzling rain, the bride and groom still exchanged vows in the great outdoors, which made for some beautifully foggy wedding photos. END

"I decided on Big Sur because it's all the beautiful things I get from the East Coast and also far enough away we could make the weekend out of it," Doubleday explained to E! News. Beautiful? Well, that's putting things lightly! END

Seriously, what's more swoon-worthy? The reception's long banquet-style tables and suspended candle décor or the bride's custom cap-sleeved gorgeous gown... END

BEGIN HERE Most brides wonder how they can make a few dollars back on their big wedding budgets, whether they consider selling their wedding dress, repurposing some of the decorations, or some other way to reuse or sell their big-day items. But flowers? Well, that was always considered a goner expense... until now? END
BEGIN HERE Good news, ladies: Selling the floral centerpieces from your wedding is possible. And, actually, this is totally a thing now, thanks to the entrepreneurial ladies behind the hot new start up, Bloomerent. After co-founder, Danit Zamir, saw the wedding flowers she had spent thousands on get thrown into the trash at the end of the night, she realized the need for a solution that would reduce waste and save money. She partnered with Julia Capalino, former CEO of Pinch Parties, and together they launched Bloomerent — an online platform that allows centerpieces to be shared between events that take place in close proximity. Yeah, we're freaking out over it, too. END
BEGIN HERE Here's how it works. Brides, grooms and event hosts alike log onto Bloomerent.com and fill out a form regarding their wedding location, date, etc. They also indicate whether they want to be an "Event A," an "Event B" or are undecided. END
BEGIN HERE Couples that choose to be an "Event A" are matched with a florist from Bloomerent's carefully curated community and the process proceeds as usual — they meet with the florist for a consultation and work with them to design their ideal wedding arrangements. After the centerpieces have been decided on by "Event A," the florist enters the centerpieces into the Bloomerent database to look for an "Event B" match that wants similar colors, styles etc. END
BEGIN HERE Potential "Event B" matches will be presented with a "floral story" which includes a mood board, quantity of centerpieces available, original price and possible photo mock up of the centerpieces so they can decide if they want to opt in and get sharing! If they do, they are matched with the same florist from "Event A" who will make all of their personal flowers for the big day and set up the shared centerpieces after refreshing them overnight and replacing any lackluster blooms. END
BEGIN HERE Bloomerent Wedding Flower Centerpieces END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Courtesy of Bloomerent    END
BEGIN HERE In the event of a match, "Event B" can save around 50 percent off of the original price of their centerpieces and "Event A" gets at least 10 percent of what they originally paid sent back to them after the wedding. If there is not a match, the process would be the same as it normally would when working with a florist, so there's nothing to lose for either party. Reducing waste and potentially saving money? What's not to love! END

BEGIN HERE Stretching 655 serpentine miles along California's coast, Highway 1 (also known as the Pacific Coast Highway), is one of the most famous roads in the US, and one of the most picturesque. The best bits, arguably, are located south of San Francisco, along the state's Central Coast. Here's how to plan the ultimate honeymoon road trip in this beautiful region. END

BEGIN HERE   It is a honeymoon, after all, so don't get so caught up in the road trip that you forget to slow down and enjoy it. Relax in a hot tub under the stars, indulge in a spa treatment at the Ventana Inn and Spa, have a candlelit dinner overlooking the ocean at the Post Ranch Inn, have your hotel pack a picnic basket for a romantic lunch under the redwoods, and toast the the sunset on a secluded beach. END
BEGIN HERE While Prince William may have stolen out hearts as our own modern day Prince Charming in the late 1990s and early 2000s, we gracefully backed off when Kate Middleton came to the scene and the pair went on to have the most magical royal wedding ever and then created the most adorable royal family ever. So now, Princess Diana's younger son, Prince Harry, has moved into the spotlight and claimed our affections with that tousled mane of red hair and too-cute-for-words smile. Every time Prince Harry's name pops up in the headlines we're both genuinely so in love as well as incredibly concerned that he will have found his own princess (and it won't be us). But, according to the red-headed prince himself, this isn't happening any time soon. Gasp! END
BEGIN HERE Harry, 31, revealed to the U.K.'s Sunday Times that he has "massive paranoia that sits inside" of him when it comes to finding a significant other. Do tell, Harry! "If or when I do find a girlfriend, I will do my utmost...to ensure that me and her can get to the point where we're actually comfortable with each other before the massive invasion that is inevitably going to happen into her privacy," he said. "The other concern is that even if I talk to a girl, that person is then suddenly my wife, and people go knocking on her door." END
BEGIN HERE While Harry isn't currently actively looking for a relationship, he told the publication he wouldn't be opposed to one if the circumstances were right. "I'm not putting work before the idea of a family, marriage and all that kind of stuff," he said. "To be fair, I haven't had that many opportunities to get out there and meet people. At the moment, my focus is very much on work. But if someone slips into my life then that's absolutely fantastic." END
BEGIN HERE Our favorite royal ginger has several high-profile romances in his past, most famously with longtime girlfriend Chelsy Davy, whom he dated on-and-off for seven years between 2004 and 2011, and his most recent ex, Cressida Bonas, whom he dated for two years before splitting in April 2014, Us Weekly reports. END
BEGIN HERE In September, the Prince and Davy sparked rumors of a rekindled romance when the 30-year-old corporate lawyer flew nearly 9,000 miles from South Africa to be with Harry on his 31st birthday. "They decided they would like to give their relationship another chance," a source close to Harry told Us Weekly at the time. "They still have strong feelings for each other." END
BEGIN HERE But despite this new news from the Prince, we can't forget that just last March, the royal uncle revealed that he is, in fact, thinking about getting married and having children of his own. "I would love to have kids right now," he told Sky News, to the delight of women around the world. "There come times when you think now is the time to settle down, or now is not, whatever way it is, but I don't think you can force these things it will happen when it's going to happen." END
BEGIN HERE In the meantime, we can still hope that Prince Harry will find his forever love stateside... maybe even in the BRIDES offices, perhaps?! Hey, a girl can dream. END
BEGIN HERE Period sex can be a seriously divisive topic. Some women think it's no biggie, while others get anxious at the thought of it. While there's nothing wrong with period sex (it a natural thing, after all), some people need a little more convincing than others. END
BEGIN HERE Whether you're thinking about having period sex for the first time or already do it on the regular, here are a few factoids worth remembering: END
BEGIN HERE Hey, remember when Heather Locklear married Mötley Crue rocker Tommy Lee in the quintessential rock and roll wedding of the '80s? We sure haven't... And apparently neither has the former bride herself! Locklear just posted the ultimate throwback photo of herself and her former husband to celebrate what would have been their 30th anniversary. A little strange? Perhaps. But who doesn't love a good 1980's throwback, right? However, we probably would've chosen a pic with a little less PDA... END
BEGIN HERE In case you're in need of BRIDES refresher course, the former Melrose Place actress and the Mötley Crue drummer tied the knot on May 10, 1986 at the swanky Biltmore Hotel in Santa Barbara, California, with both the bride and groom rocking some serious retro looks — feathered bangs and all. Lee's fellow Mötley Crue members, Vince Neil and Nikki Sixx, were included in the festivities as groomsmen, natch. But after seven years of marriage, the pair called it quits in 1993. Since the divorce, Locklear wed guitarist Richie Sambora and Lee infamously married Pamela Anderson just four days after meeting her the year after. Sadly, both of those marriages also ended in divorce. But, hey, at least these two exes seem amicable. One look at Locklear's tongue-on-tongue throwback pic and you'd have to agree. END
BEGIN HERE To mark what would have been the 30th anniversary of their 1986 marriage, Locklear took to Instagram and gave her former hubby a steamy shout-out. "Happy 30 years baby," the actress captioned the pic, which featured her sitting on Lee's lap and engaged in a pretty hot and heavy lip lock! END
BEGIN HERE Locklear also posted a second (and more suitable for work) photo, taken on her and Lee's actual wedding day, with Locklear wearing her '80s-style, wedding dress Lee rocking his white suit, and the Mötley Crue band members in tow. Talk about a throwback! END

BEGIN HERE Some marriage advice you just shouldn't listen to. But other tidbits are valuable tools. And here to help you weed out the bad and focus on the very best advice are five real brides, ready to share the wisdom that has kept their marriages strong. END
BEGIN HERE   Says Holly, "My advice came from a good friend of mine who had been married END
BEGIN HERE   for many years, who told me, 'always make time for date night each week.' At first, it seemed like a given that we would always keep dating each other. But as time wore on, that advice has been invaluable. Carving out time for a date night gets harder because life picks up, you both get busy, careers and family are demanding on your time. The love of your life and your marriage will both thrive if you create dedicated 'us time' each week — time to get out of the house, away from life's pressures, and just look into each others eyes and talk. It's amazing how connected you'll grow." END
BEGIN HERE Runway shows have come and gone, but we're riding the wave of bridal style through the rest of the season! And while we love the classic designs that ruled the runway, we're featuring the standout trends that got our hearts aflutter. Inspired by the runway collections of Maggie Sottero Designs, we've rounded up our favorite new looks for 2016 and 2017 brides — from down-to-there necklines to alluring off-the-shoulder looks, these trends are ready to walk down the aisle!

BEGIN HERE After the initial wave of engagement excitement has begun to wear off and you find yourself knee-deep in wedding planning, you may start to see yourself getting a little more stressed out than usual. Constant decision making, pressure-filled deadlines to get everything picked and planned ASAP, and the occasional nags from family members may have you feeling like you're going to explode at any moment and desperately need to take a step back and unwind. Unsure if you're moments away from a wedding planning meltdown? Here are 10 signs you're too stressed out with your wedding planning tasks. END

But there's one more person whose emotions will be running high: Your mother. So whether she's been stressed and pushy for weeks or it suddenly comes out the morning of your Big Day, we asked our experts for ways to handle the dreaded Momzilla on your wedding day. END
BEGIN HERE Keeping Mom calm will have all sorts of benefits, from helping you stay on top of your own nerves and allowing your planner to do his or her job without distraction to making sure the person who knows you best is ready to help you down the aisle. And, of course, she'll have way more fun celebrating with you! Here are a few ways to tame the Momzilla if she rears her ugly head. END

BEGIN HERE In case there was ever any doubt, Blake Lively's new maternity wear is in full swing, and it's taking the 2016 Cannes Film Festival red carpet by storm. The actress, who's expecting her second child with her actor husband Ryan Reynolds, was simply glowing among her Café Society cast members as she stepped out for the premiere of the new movie in a shimmery, body-hugging gown that, more importantly, made no effort to hide her baby bump.

BEGIN HERE The body-conscious, spaghetti strap, trumpet gown hugged Lively's growing pregnancy curves as the actress gracefully walked the red carpet in silver sandals with a slight train following behind her. Lively wore her blonde hair down around her shoulders with a side part and loose waves. Simply put: She looked stunning (no shocker there). END

BEGIN HERE "Blake is absolutely thrilled and so is Ryan," a source close to Lively, 28, and her husband Ryan Reynolds, 39, told People in April following their super exciting pregnancy news. END
BEGIN HERE While this isn't Lively's first strut on the red carpet since news of her second pregnancy broke in April, we have yet to catch a good, solid glimpse of the actress' baby bump. (And, needless to say, we were intrigued.) Earlier this month, we were anxious to see her Met Gala maternity look, but Lively covered up her belly with a lovely pink A-line Burberry gown. END
BEGIN HERE Wednesday morning at Cannes, the actress squashed our hopes again by stepping out for the festival in a fire-engine-red, form-fitting jumpsuit that only slightly hinted at something more than a food baby. END

BEGIN HERE So alas! Reynolds and Lively's second, sure-to-be-adorable child has made its Hollywood debut. The new parents welcomed their first daughter, James, at the end of 2014 and, during Lively's first pregnancy, we got to see ALL the glamorous maternity looks from the starlet. And given her latest ensemble, it seems that we can expect Lively to pull out the stops, yet again, for her second time as a mommy-to-be. END

BEGIN HERE What would you do if a newlywed couple — who you had shelled out a generous $100+ for as a wedding gift — sent you an email requesting more money from you? Sadly, this is a real thing that happened to a woman in the UK after she gifted a couple a 100 pound check for their new life together. Instead of the bride simply thanking her ex-colleague for the kind gesture, she had the gall to send this: END
BEGIN HERE "We were surprised that your contribution didn't seem to match the warmth of your good wishes on our big day. In view of your own position, if you wanted to send any adjustment it would be thankfully received." END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Giphy    END
BEGIN HERE Appalled and outraged, the ex-colleague took to a Mumsnet forum to ask for advice on what she should do in this shocking situation. As you can imagine, the Internet was not pleased. According to The Guardian, "Within three days she was inundated with more than a thousand responses, with many urging her to cancel the check altogether." END
BEGIN HERE The aggravated guest wrote on the forum saying she was "gobsmacked" and went on to explain that her "own position" was most likely referring to the fact that she had recently inherited some money. She asked the people of the Internet, "Please anyone, what do I do now? I've never come across anything like this before and still can't quite believe they've done it — but since they have, should I reply, ring them, ignore it, or what?" END
BEGIN HERE Some users proposed that the guest simply cancel the check, while others suggested otherwise. One user wrote, "I would email back but BCC any mutual friends in so they are able to see the email for themselves. That is entitled and grabby. It's a gift not an obligation and many people wouldn't have given so much to an ex-colleague." END
BEGIN HERE Truuu dat. END
BEGIN HERE Another user said, "Whatever the circumstance that is very rude. As to whether or not the gift was appropriate: did you bowl up with a partner and six children and proceed to demolish the buffet and free bar? No? Then 100 pounds is a generous gift to an ex-colleague." END
BEGIN HERE ! END
BEGIN HERE After months of listening to mutual friends drop not-so-subtle hints that they'd hit it off, Brooke Stein and Adam Moss finally met — without even knowing that the other was the suitor their friends had babbled on about. Luckily, a friend spotted them sitting together and later connected the dots for the duo, and after the success of their first official date, the new pair couldn't help but agree with their friends' assessment: Brooke and Adam were a perfect match. Two years later, Adam popped the question. And about a year after that, on July 25, 2015, the pair tied the knot in Jackson, Wyoming. END
BEGIN HERE It was important to bride and groom that their guests needs came first at this destination wedding, so Brooke and Adam dreamed up a weekend where family and friends could be together and celebrate in a chic, elegant, and fun outdoor setting. At the Jackson Hole Golf and Tennis Club, nestled in the Tetons, it was impossibly easy for the couple to plan a dreamy celebration, and the only pre-wedding necessity was accentuating the venue's natural beauty. With the help of Amy Zaroff Events, they did just that. And lucky for us, La Vie Photography didn't miss a single stunning detail. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: La Vie Photography    END
BEGIN HERE Brooke and Adam invited 200 friends and family members to join in the celebration. Their paper suite, which played up the mountain setting of the wedding, included invitations not only to the wedding but also to a welcome party, rehearsal dinner, and a brunch, making their big day a true weekend-long getaway. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: La Vie Photography    END
BEGIN HERE With her mother and grandmother by her side, Brooke knew she had found The One when she slipped on her Monique Lhuillier wedding dress because she couldn't wipe the smile from her face. The strapless trumpet-style dress featured Chantilly lace and a gathered tulle overlay. "It was just so comfortable and fun to wear," Brooke says. END
BEGIN HERE Brooke completed her bridal look with family heirloom jewels, including aquamarine earrings and a gold bracelet, and carried a wild bouquet of ranunculus, roses, eucalyptus, and other greens. Adam, who looked dashing in his classic black-and-white tuxedo, tucked a pocket square into his jacket and pinned a twine-tied boutonniere to his lapel. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: La Vie Photography    END
BEGIN HERE While the couple's groomsmen mirrored the groom in classic tuxes, the bridesmaids wore convertible Jenny Yoo gowns, which gave them the freedom to each dress a little differently. "I chose this dress because my sisters loved it, and because I wanted each bridesmaid to be able to customize the dress so that they could feel gorgeous and fabulous on the wedding day," Brooke says. END

BEGIN HERE The bridesmaids carried all-baby's breath bouquets, also tied with rustic twine. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: La Vie Photography    END
BEGIN HERE "We wanted to be married in a location that was outdoors and embodied simple, stunning elegance," says Brooke. Since their ceremony held on the club's golf course (where views of the towering Tetons serve as a backdrop) the couple needed little in the way of decoration. But what they did add was almost as breathtaking as the natural views: Aged wine barrels covered in baby's breath and a birch branch chuppah that was draped in greens and flowers complemented the setting. END
BEGIN HERE The couple's flower girls, dressed in gold shimmering tutus and cowboy boots, raced down the aisle at full speed. One even lost a boot along the way. "The youngest got stage fright and had to be carried down the aisle by her grandfather. They were adorable, funny and silly, and we wouldn't have had it any other way," says the bride. END
BEGIN HERE During the ceremony, Brooke and Adam exchanged traditional Jewish vows. Their rabbi also read excerpts from their Ketubah, which was painted by the bride's grandmother. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: La Vie Photography    END
BEGIN HERE The couple's favorite design detail? The custom bourbon and champagne displays, which were made from wooden ladders and boards and decorated with green wreaths. Drinks in hand, guests could lounge outside on vintage-inspired furniture or sit at cocktail tables topped with wild floral arrangements held in birch vases. END

And just now, another wedding day detail seems to have fallen into place — the wedding venue! A source just spilled that Cyrus and Hemsworth will be tying the knot in — drumroll, please... — Australia! END
BEGIN HERE Only last week, The Last Song co-stars were spotted holding hands in Hemsworth's homeland going on a lunch date with the groom-to-be's parents in Byron Bay. Cyrus' Neil Lane cushion-cut engagement ring that she's been sporting since January was of course also in tow. But, according to Us Weekly, that wasn't just a regular old lunch with the 'rents. The private pair was actually in the beachside town to scout wedding venues! "They were discussing potential venues and looking around," the insider divulged to the gossip mag. END

BEGIN HERE Good, experienced wedding vendors are reliable, and once you have a contract and pay a deposit, you have nothing to worry about. They've blocked your wedding date on their calendars, and they'll be sure to confirm the times with you closer to the date if you haven't already gotten in touch. END
BEGIN HERE Unfortunately, not every wedding vendor is as experienced and reliable as the next, and you have to stay on top of things to make sure that nothing slips through the cracks for your big day, especially if you're planning your own wedding. END
BEGIN HERE If you have a wedding planner, that's the person responsible for keeping in touch with your vendors and making sure they've got everything ready to go for your big day. You should review the schedule with your planner — in detail — but it's likely the coordinator's job to contact each vendor and confirm. END
BEGIN HERE DIY brides and grooms, on the other hand, must take responsibility for every little detail of their weddings, and that includes making sure the vendors know what's going on. It's very easy to start contacting everybody about a slight change in time, for example, and forget to tell somebody important about the switch, if you're not using a checklist and taking notes. Telling the minister and the violins you're going to start 30 minutes early doesn't help if you forget to notify the florist. On the wedding day, it's too late to fix the mistake. END

BEGIN HERE It took a little bit of digging, but it turns out that sometimes the real problem is underlying, damaging ideas about how things really work.

In a video one of the couple's wedding guests recorded, the bride and the groom are about to tie the knot when they're suddenly met with an unexpected interruption to their nuptials. Just as the officiant explained the significance behind the wedding bands the couple were currently exchanging, the groom's apparent "side chick" decided that this would be the moment to strike. END

BEGIN HERE Excuse us, but did this woman just tell a bride's entire wedding that the man she was about to marry was in bed with her just a few hours ago?! Our heads are spinning. What. Is. Happening. END
BEGIN HERE The shocked wedding guests react the way one would in that situation — plenty of shocked gasps, Ohhhh's, and "Did you hear that's?!" could be heard throughout the video. One onlooker towards the front even gets up and storms towards the back of the church. We can only imagine that this is the mother of the bride on her way to whip some butt.... END
BEGIN HERE However, the bride and groom actually don't have much a reaction at all. But we're sure that the poor girl is raging on the inside, while the groom is inwardly panicking ("The jig is up..."). While we don't have the full story of course, here's hoping that bride hiked up her dress and hightailed it out of there. Never have we ever wanted to pull a Charlotte York à la the Sex and the City movie so badly. END

Despite the acclaimed actor being one of the most handsome men in Hollywood, hands down, and — before his flawless human rights lawyer wife Amal came on to the scene and they married in an absurdly stunning Italian wedding — he was also one of the most eligible bachelors in Tinseltown, Clooney apparently just enjoys the simple things in life. Or at least, that's the conclusion we're drawing based on the, er, interesting birthday gift Amal gifted to her hubby for his 55th birthday. END

The couple planned an event-filled weekend for their guests, with an itinerary full of dinners, cocktails, and more. In front of a wall brimming with white candles at the Aman Canal Grande Hotel in Venice, Italy, George and Amal, clad in a gorgeous Oscar de la Renta lace wedding dress, exchanged their vows in an intimate ceremony with 100 of their nearest and dearest, including Matt Damon and wife Luciana, Rande Gerber and his supermodel wife Cindy Crawford, Ellen Barkin, John Krasinski and Emily Blunt, Bono, Anna Wintour, and Bill Murray (who happily gave a toast at the reception). END

BEGIN HERE While their wedding was the definition of perfect, their proposal... not so much. The actor told Ellen Degeneres earlier this year that his proposal to Amal had some hiccups. "I've got it all set up, timed out and the song is coming and she gets up to go wash the dishes, which she's never done," he told Ellen. "And I'm like, 'What are you doing?' and she comes back in. And finally I said, 'Ya know, I blew out the candle' and I said, 'I think the lighter's in the box behind you.' And she reaches around and she pulls out the box and I've got just the ring sitting in there and she pulls it out and she looks at it and she's like, 'It's a ring' — like as if somebody had left it there some other time."

BEGIN HERE Brides aren't the only ones to experience wedding-day freak outs. Sometimes they're warranted, and sometimes they're not. We'll let you be the judge. Here, four grooms revealed what got them worked up and worried on their wedding days. END
BEGIN HERE   Gary had carefully selected a traditional tuxedo for his wedding day, complete with tails, a white shirt, cummerbund, and a paisley bow tie. But when he went to grab his attire out of his mother's closet on the wedding day, "the tie and cummerbund were not there," he says. "I started to freak out, and realized I must've left them behind in our apartment." Gary sped back to the apartment he shared with his soon-to-be bride, only to find the rest of his outfit also wasn't in his own closet. "I sat down to weigh my options, and gather my thoughts," he recalls. "They had to be somewhere, I thought. I returned to the closet and did a second pass, and there, dangling on a hanger, were the garments. Somehow I had missed them the first time in my panic. The incident added a lot of stress to an already stressful day." END
BEGIN HERE We don't know what we love more about Jersey Shore star Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi — her interesting style sense (never forget those leopard-print fuzzy slippers) or her brutal honesty in all situations. Well, after the sassy reality star appeared on an episode of People's Mom Talk, we're going to have to choose the latter. END
BEGIN HERE Snooks bared all when Orange is the New Black actress Alysia Reiner talked about going on  weekend getaways with her hubby to keep things fresh. She said, "We try to go on vacation, just the two of us, at least once a year." Reiner explained that is helps them to reconnect when they spend a little time away from their 7-year-old daughter, Livia Charles. END
BEGIN HERE But they don't stay away for too long. "Just for a long weekend," Reiner added. "And have that deeply romantic, just-about-us time." Of course, Snooki knew exaaaactly what she meant when she said "just-us time" and chimed in, "Just sex," with a coy smile. END
BEGIN HERE Totally jumping on board, Reiner added with a giggle, "Sex with noise. Because it's like...I had sex this morning, but it was really quiet!" END
BEGIN HERE Oh the struggles of parenthood. END
BEGIN HERE Snooki, now a mom to 19-month-old cutie, Giovanna Marie, and 3-year-old Lorenzo Dominic, couldn't agree more. So she took it one step further, Jersey Shore-style, saying, "Just being, like, a porn star." END
BEGIN HERE "Exactly, porn-star sex is really what vacations are about!" Reiner responded with a laugh. "Those quiet quickies are awesome, but you need a little more sometimes." Well that certainly escalated quickly. END
BEGIN HERE Moral to the story? Have a lot of bunny rabbit hump seshes before adding new — and very needy — members to your family. Or, you know, just take some MUCH needed vacay's away from the kiddos like these wise celeb couples. Your inner porn-star is just waiting to come out. Or something like that... END

BEGIN HERE While slimming, smoothing, lifting, and tucking shapewear might be the first thing you think of when you start looking for what you'll wear under your wedding gown, it's not the only option, especially if you're opting for an A-line, ball gown, or a fitted silhouette with a less skin-tight shape or more textured fabric. If you want something skimpy or sleek, more power to you, but if you want something comfy that you'll be happy to wear for a 12-hour day? These adorable undies are for you! END

BEGIN HERE While grooms may not be eager to get involved in every aspect of wedding planning, there are a few parts they'll want to be a part of, like the music, food, and bar. And if you've got a fashion-savvy groom (or one who knows exactly what he wants his groomsmen to wear!), the guys' attire might get added to his list, too. And what wedding-planning bride wouldn't be happy to have one less thing on her list? But what happens when he comes back with a receipt for a suit order or a shopping bag full of clothes, and you totally HATE what he picked? Here's what our experts say you should do. END
BEGIN HERE First, figure out what it is that you don't like. Did he pick suits when the event is supposed to be black tie? Or opt for ties in a garish color that totally clashes with all of the carefully-planned details? Identify the problem, then start looking for a solution. END
BEGIN HERE For a case of mismatched colors (say, orange-y red when the color scheme is burgundy and mauve), head back to the store with him — armed with color swatches from your linens or bridesmaids' dresses. Either return whatever he's already purchased, or update the rental orders with a new color. END
BEGIN HERE Did he totally miss the dress code? Cross your fingers that no one has bought anything yet! You'll need to either head to a rental shop (or an online suit and tux rental site) and place an order for attire that matches your dress code. END
BEGIN HERE If it's really just a matter of taste (he wants to wear sneakers with his suit or loves the classic three-piece while you're more of a modern, slim-fit kind of gal), see where you can negotiate. Will he and his guys wear dress shoes for the ceremony and change into sneakers for the reception? Or keep the vest but opt for a more contemporary silhouette? Start practicing your compromising skills! END

BEGIN HERE The big day went down in 2011 in an intimate, family-only ceremony (including Followill's Kings of Leon bandmates and real-life brothers, of course) at San Ysidro Ranch in Montecito, reported US Weekly. The Sports Illustrated model wore a custom-designed, strapless Vera Wang gown. Layers of chantilly and corded lace appliqué and raw edge swirling chiffon adorned the dress — sounds extravagant, but it looked stunning on her svelte physique. Her musically-inclined hubs wore a Gucci suit and light gold tie. END
BEGIN HERE As far as the wedding-day scene, "Caleb and Lily had coffee and pastries and everyone sat around chatting. There was a relaxed vibe and everyone took their time eating and taking in the nice weather," a source shared. The lovebirds said their vows underneath a big tree with twinkle lights just before sunset. "Lily cried throughout the whole thing." END
BEGIN HERE While the two seem to be totally meant for each other when it comes to their wedding style and chemistry, Followill shared a funny story with People about his bride's pre-wedding communication. "You have to ask Lily [about the wedding date]. She won't tell me. I think it's somewhere between May 10 and May 20, but she won't tell me because I have a big mouth." How's that for keeping your groom in the dark! END

BEGIN HERE When New Orleans Saints linebacker Dannell Ellerbe stopped into a North Carolina Footlocker, he was looking for a pair of sneakers — but ended up finding his wife, instead. "He came in three or four days in a row for a pair of shoes that he never bought!" says his now wife, Shervella. In December of 2014, between football seasons, Dannell finally went with Shervella to visit Flamingo Garden in Davie, Florida ("I'd been bugging him about going for months!" she says). They toured the park and, just before they left, he asked her to stop and sit on a bench with him. A few minutes later, he stood up and popped the question. "I said yes, and then a cameraman came out of nowhere and started snapping pictures!" END
BEGIN HERE A year and a half later, on May 23, 2015, the pair walked down the aisle at the Grand Marquise Ballroom in Garner, North Carolina, the perfect spot for their 250 guests and their timeless, elegant vision.

But things got a little derailed when the bride's sister, maid of honor Faye West, spotted a baby bird in need of saving. Bridesmaid, to the rescue! END

Devastated, I wept and told my fiancé this was a sign we should just stop spending this fortune and elope, but he was set on having his friends and family all there. We re-planned, but my heart largely wasn't in it. What got me back on track was the realization that it didn't really matter where it was or who else was there. Then I didn't care what else happened or who showed up. We bonded in a special way by going through that together. —Chelsea END

Mom was healthy enough to enjoy it, though started declining soon after, and I look back now on the wedding day as such a special memory because we were still all there." —Helen END
BEGIN HERE "Starting the wedding planning process was overwhelming. There were so many decisions to make, and I'm not the most organized person. And my entire family kept chiming in with their opinions. I started getting depressed and dreading each appointment.

I realized it was because our lives together had been taken over by the big day. We made some rules — no wedding talk allowed three nights a week and we reinstituted date night, a ritual we'd let slide shortly after our engagement. Allowing time to decompress and remind ourselves that we were the important element in what was going on helped me center myself and regroup. It ultimately wasn't important if Aunt Mabel wasn't thrilled with the seating arrangement! The wedding day was beautiful, but our subsequent life together is what is truly enriching." —Ruth END

BEGIN HERE "It was the Monday after I ran the Long Island Half Marathon. I woke up still exhausted from those 13 miles that my legs carried me through the day before. I'm an 8th grade English teacher and just kept thinking, 'In 9 periods you'll be home for a nap...just get through 9 periods.' Sixth period rolled around and in my school we are lucky enough to integrate English and Social Studies. I figured this would be a good time for a quick bathroom break before my 7th period class. While finishing up I could hear people talking in the hallway. I assumed because it was May, it had to be the custodians preparing to turn on the air conditioning. As I opened the door, I was staring back at someone I knew; Ron's brother's girlfriend looked like a deer in headlights. She was holding a video camera and while my brain tried to process why she was standing in my hallway I heard a man yelling my principals name. The man in my hallway was Ron! IT WAS RON! It's pretty safe to say I contemplated every illogical thought as to why he was standing in front of me shot through my brain like rapid fire. My principal's secretary and Ron's sister were also standing behind me taking pictures as I repeated the question, "What are you doing here?" Ron held my hand as we walked towards my classroom. Mrs. Rodahan, my principal, was carrying a bouquet of a dozen blood red roses. As we walked into my classroom, I began to cry. Ron introduced himself to my 40, curious students. I listened as he commanded the floor and my students would start to realize what was happening. This would become the greatest surprise of my life. Ron asked all of my students to stand at the front of the class, facing me, and handed two of them a sign to be unraveled in his cue. In front of forty students and four adults, he took my hand, told me how much he loved me, and bent down on one knee as his sign would be opened to read, "Ms. Ariel, Will You Marry Me?"...and of course, I said YES!" — Jennifer N.

BEGIN HERE "Two days before the proposal my best friend (who lives in Atlanta) told me she was flying in that weekend for work. I didn't think anything of it. Joe had told me he had to work that Saturday night, so I of course, wanted to get dinner and drinks with my best friend downtown West Palm. We got all dressed up and left for dinner and things were getting pretty weird during the drive there. Everything she was saying wasn't adding up (turns out she was just stalling so Joe could get to the proposal site). We get down there and she asks for a picture down by the water so I go (kind of annoyed cause it was Florida in May and VERY hot outside!) We walk to the end of the dock to take the picture and I turn around and Paige (my best friend) doesn't join me. Then I hear someone walking up behind me and I turn around and it was Joe! He had a dozen pink roses in his hand and I immediately started crying. I knew what was happening. I honestly can't even tell you what Joe said during the proposal because I was so overcome with emotions and tears. But after a few minutes he got down on one knee and proposed with the most GORGEOUS ring (that I picked out months ago). I of course said yes while balling my eyes out. It was absolutely perfect in every way. I then turned around and saw my family walking up behind me snapping pictures and I had no clue they were there! I was so happy they could witness the best moment of my life. And turns out Paige wasn't there for a work meeting, Joe had her fly in for the proposal. Best friend EVER and best fiancé ever!!!" — Kelsey Shinn END

BEGIN HERE "My now fiancé and I met senior year of high school, spring break in the Bahamas. We immediately hit it off and had a great spring break. Last place you think you would find your husband, right? We both knew we were going off to college, so we didn't take things seriously. Except a few months into college and we realized we didn't want to be single. We made it official and dated long distance all through college. After graduating we moved back to New York and had so much fun finally being in the same state. Fast forward three years later, I got home from work on a Thursday night, and he told me to pack my bags, and that a car was coming to pick us up at 4am. He wouldn't tell me where we were going he just told me I needed to pack beach clothes. We get to the airport and get to our gate, and I see we are going to the Bahamas. I mentioned we both hadn't been there since we met eight years ago. Embarrassingly enough, I was still clueless. (We recently had "the conversation" and agreed we were in no rush to plan a wedding). When we got there and got settled into the hotel, we had a nice day on the beach. Later that night he had a car pick us up to take us to The One and Only resort. Years ago I had told him this is a dream wedding venue (I don't know how he remembered that!), but when we were on the way I started to realize something was up!! He went to the bathroom and I was escorted in a golf cart to the restaurant. They dropped me off at their beautiful garden, and I saw from a distance my fiancé was standing all the way at the top waiting for me with his arms crossed. I had to walk all the up to him crying, in heels!! He asked me to spend the rest of my life with him. We are now getting married and this proposal is one I will remember forever." — Jaclyn Tarica END

BEGIN HERE "My fiancé's name is Stavros Makropoulos, I am Monica Kucera. Technically you can say we met on Facebook. Our parents made an effort to set us up but it stopped after his dad said, "You'd be a perfect fit for my son! But, oh, he hates when I set him up with Greek girls so you have to call him!" I'm like, "What!" Well, I ended up friending him on Facebook like a huge creep and the rest is history! Prior to meeting Stavros, I completed two marathons and a few half marathons. After we met, he said he wanted to "get into running" so naturally I told him we should sign up for a half marathon together. We started running them in March/April so we could begin training around the new year to make a New Year's Resolution out of it. For our third half marathon together, we chose the Sly Fox Half Marathon in St. Charles because the first two we ran were in Chicago and we wanted to do something a little different this year. Plus it fit perfectly in our March/April time frame (but little did I know, Stavros had something else in mind). I was so completely surprised about the proposal. I told Stavros I envisioned our proposal being more private. It ended up being the complete opposite! All of our close friends and family were there and it wound up being AMAZING. I couldn't have pictured it any other way. It was like a fairytale." — Monica Kucera  END

BEGIN HERE "We met in our apartment laundry room 3 years ago, and it was love at first sight! I had learned to ski a few years back and told him that in order to date me, he would have to get back on a snowboard. We now work on Slope Security at Shawnee Ski Mountain in PA. On our first ski trip out west over spring break this year, we got to the top of Copper Mountain for our first run of the day, and it was absolutely beautiful weather with breathtaking views. Clint asked me to look at the trail map and while I did, he got down on one knee. My uncle called to me to turn around and look down. I asked why just as I saw Clint on one knee. I said, "Oh my god!" I immediately broke into tears at the sight of my great grandma's stone in the setting. The ring glistened almost a blue color due to how blue the sky was! All I could do after that was nod yes and kiss him! The proposal could not have been more perfect for us, and I can thank my uncle and cousin for their pictures and video to remember and share the moment." — Kara Farruggia END

BEGIN HERE "Nick got my father involved in the proposal. He had dad tell me we had a work meeting in Santa Barbara. So Dad and I drove up to Santa Barbara and stopped at our family's beach house at Rincon Point. I went inside to grab the missing item and found red roses and a note. The note showed me a map to the beach. I ran so fast. When I got to the beach there were roses lined in the sand with pictures of us starting from the very beginning of our relationship and ending with a picture of our church. I followed the roses and found him. He got down on one knee and asked me to be his wife and to "change the world together" I said yes! and immediately knelt down to hug him before he even had a chance to put the ring on my finger. It was perfect. Then he surprised me with having a nice outfit picked out to go to dinner with my family and his to celebrate." — Diana Sala  END

BEGIN HERE "It has been my dream to travel in Europe. We were trying to save for a house, however I had my mind set on traveling which Bill (partner) didn't really want too. He allowed me to go over with a girlfriend and do a tour. We had one week in London with no plans, Bill saw his perfect opportunity and sent me a message saying in two days you must be at Hyde Park, by the round pond for a surprise. I thought deep down how lovely it would be if it was him but I couldn't see him justifying the money to go over when he always said no. As I ran through Hyde Park (late), I looked up and saw Bill standing by a tree. It was emotional and I gave him the biggest hug. Yet the moment didn't stop there. He walked me through a garden tunnel in Kensington Gardens and asked me to marry him. Of course I said yes, so caught up in the moment I cried and forgot if I had even answered him. It was the most perfect proposal and we often get comments. Bill is not romantic but he saw his perfect opportunity." — Casey Hiskens END

BEGIN HERE "We actually met online and had been dating for about two years when he asked me if i could get time off from work at the end the February for a "surprise trip." I am ALL about surprises and trips and was lucky enough to get the 10 days off for a California road trip he planned all by himself! He made a folder and itinerary and researched the best sights to see! I am a native of Michigan so driving north up the coast of highway 1 was incredible to say the least. We stopped at few magical, beautiful place but he proposed on Pfieffer Beach in Big Sur. END
BEGIN HERE "We actually got lost trying to find it! And Corbin was so anxious because the sun sets so quickly - I told him to calm down because obviously I didn't know what he had in mind, but I figured we could run to the beach and see the last few seconds at least! But luckily we made it with time to spare! This beach is gorgeous and so unique – purple sand and rock arches with waves splashing through. Corbin was off looking at these enormous pieces of washed up seaweed and I saw a lady with a large professional camera, way fancier than what I had but I figured she'd be able to work mine so asked her to take a picture. She said of course... I waved Corbin down, we posed, the picture was snapped and she came up to us and said the background was perfect but only our silhouettes were showing up in the picture because of the sun. She suggested to do something "romantic." As I'm staring to the ocean and sunset, still thinking of what we could do that was romantic, little did I know Corbin has dropped on one knee and said, no joke, "Romantic like this?" I was in shock! He had been carrying the ring around in his pocket for days waiting for the perfect moment and it honestly could not have been better!! And to make it more unique, the stranger that took our picture was celebrating her 60th wedding anniversary so I took pictures of them after our proposal! 60 years?! I can only hope Corbin and I will be so lucky to travel back to that beach 60 years from the day we wed!" — Erin Walters END

BEGIN HERE "The day was January 16, 2016. It was one of the coldest days of the winter so far in Minnesota. My boyfriend, Tom said he had a surprise date night planned for us, but he wouldn't tell me what it was. All he said was "pack an overnight bag." Oh boy! I don't know what we are doing AND I need multiple outfits?! But I did as he said and then we got in his car and drove. We ended up at the St. Paul Hotel, which is the fanciest hotel in St. Paul. I had always wanted to stay there and he knew that. I was so excited! We checked in, got to our room and unpacked our things. He then informed me that we had dinner reservations at 7pm, but again he wouldn't tell me where. We hung out, watched some TV, played some cards and then we got ready for our dinner out. As we were heading out the door, Tom said we were going to walk to dinner. I said I had hoped the restaurant was close, because it was -30 below windchill outside! But he didn't say anything, so I figured it was ok. We walked outside and since I didn't know where we were going, Tom took my hand and was leading the way. We walked right through Rice Park, which had white twinkle lights on all the trees, and they were all lit up. All of a sudden, Tom stopped and turned to me. He took my hands and said that he had ulterior motives for tonight's plans. I had no idea what he was talking about! Then he got down on one knee and started saying how special I was and how much he loved me, and then asked me to marry him! Of course I said yes! It was one of the most magical and romantic moments of my life. Then a photographer popped out of nowhere and she had captured the whole thing. Tom had gone and hired a photographer to get the moment on film, so we would always have it. I thought that was so special. After a few laughs and tears, we said good-bye to the photographer and continued our walk to dinner. Pazzaluna is a delicious Italian restaurant, one of my favorites, that is located right across the street from the St. Paul Hotel. When we walked in, the hostess said our table was ready and the rest of our party was already here. What?! The rest of our party? I was confused, who else was there? Waiting at the table for us was my parents and Tom's parents, with champagne and lots of excitement! Tom also wanted to include our parents in the proposal because we are both very close with them. They were so honored and excited to be included. I was so touched that Tom put so much thought and planning into the proposal. It definitely is a day I will NEVER forget." — Dana Hogan END

BEGIN HERE I" couldn't have dreamed of a better weekend. After he proposed on my favorite beach, I looked up to see family and friends cheering, fireworks and huge banners saying SAY YES! I went upstairs to the beach club house, where I was greeted by friends and family that flew in for the proposal. Then they played this video. I could watch it on repeat forever and rewind this weekend a million times. Our story begins before Billy and I were born. Our grandparents were best friends and Billy became best friends with my cousin. Even though we lived so close and shared so many connections, Billy and I never really knew each other. We crossed paths in college once, but it wasn't until I randomly visited his college, the University of Alabama, that we got to know each other. We went on our first date when we moved home & the rest is history! We have been through so much since we have been together. SO many good times, so many fun times, but unfortunately we've had to face difficult times. Billy's dad was unexpectedly diagnosed with a brain cancer called Glioblastoma in 1/2014 and passed 10 months later. The whole town of Jupiter knew his father, known as always giving back to the community. Only 8 months later, Billy's nephew, Austin Stephanos, went missing. Him & his friend Perry left the Jupiter Inlet on Austin's boat and never returned. We miss Billy's dad and Austin more than anything. Billy's dad asked me the first day he met me when the wedding was and Austin called me his Aunt, before Billy and I even met, as I used to babysit him. Them being there with us is the only thing that could make our love story more magical." — Julianne Johnson END

BEGIN HERE "My proposal was so thought out and perfect it is something you would read about in a fairy tale! I went to college in Paris and the city is a huge part of who I am, my fiancé had never been before so we planned a trip. We had been planning the trip for a year so I didn't think a proposal would happen since we had our days completely planned out, but leave it to Ken to surprise me. The weather was touch and go while we were there (typical Paris showers) so we had to reschedule a few of our afternoons for earlier in the week, one of which was a private boat tour on La Seine. We rescheduled our boat tour for the same day we were having dinner at Le Cinq, so Ken thought it would be best if we dressed up for the boat tour and then went straight to dinner for a cocktail before. As we are driving to our boat tour our driver asks if he could drop us off on one side of the Pont Bir-Hakeim bridge and we could walk to the boat on the other side (yes, even the driver was in on the proposal!). We got out and as we are walking across the bridge Ken stops turns to me and drops down on one knee, I was completely shocked!! To top it all off, he had hired a photographer to capture every second and take our engagement photos later in the week in Paris! After a few photos, we hopped on the boat and sailed down La Seine. It was truly the most romantic thoughtful proposal and it still gives me goosebumps." — Jodi Sparrow END

As I was getting ready for our date my best friend, Nicole called me. She surprised me and came to Omaha, Nebraska from Florida! I was ecstatic and we planned to meet up for drinks prior to Wade and my date. Nicole was waiting for us at Heartland of America park with her boyfriend, I was thrilled to see them both! After reconnecting with my best friend Nicole states, "I am not the real surprise." and turns me around. I turn to find the love of my life down on one knee holding the most beautiful pear shaped engagement ring. If I told you what he said when he asked that would be a lie because I began crying instantly and kissed him! Eventually I said the word he was waiting to hear, "Yes!"  We continued to celebrate by going to the Twisted Fork in the Old Market for dinner, the first place we had been on a date to in Omaha. After dinner, we headed back to our apartment planning to meet up with friends later in the evening. To my surprise the night was not over. Wade planned a surprise engagement party at our apartment with our closest friends! We set our date for June, 3, 2017!" — Emilee Davenport END

BEGIN HERE "Alabama guy and a Texas girl. He surprised me in Big Sur with a 70's camper (56 acres all to ourselves) sitting on the side of a mountain overlooking the ocean. We were the only two people within miles of gorgeous untouched Big Sur. It was his birthday and we hiked down to a forest filled with Redwoods and a river flowing through it. Mid-hike we stopped and had some lunch and a few beers on a giant redwood that had fallen down. He starts to show me a video of all these memorable moments we have had. Me graduating college, our road trips, him hiding the ring and this surprise for months, and the final video was him balancing a ring on our dog Vader's nose. He got down on one knee and I could not stop crying. Afterwards, we jumped into a freezing waterhole and spent the week enjoying Big Sur all to ourselves. Whale watching and outdoor showers highly recommended. We are getting married this November in the city where we had our first date!" — Suzanna Garza  END

BEGIN HERE "My fiancé Josiah planned an adventurous afternoon rock climbing by the New River in Virginia. When we got there, I set up the hammock while he climbed to the top to set up the rope. Little did I know he was setting up tons of GoPros to get the entire proposal on video. He rappelled down after setting up and said we should walk around the route first just so I could get a feel for the rock outside. We started walking up and he was behind me making sure I didn't fall. About half way up, he shot in front of me and started climbing really fast. I was a little frustrated he left me behind, but kept climbing (okay, I got stuck a few times) until I got to the top. And that's when I saw him, on his knee with something in his hand. He helped me down and we stood on the edge of the ascent overlooking the tree line and river when he asked,"Will you marry me?" I immediately said, "Yes!" and leaned in for a kiss. It was definitely the most "Josiah" way of proposing, which made it all the more special. November 8, 2015, we got engaged and began planning to become Mr. and Mrs. Bumgarner." — Sierra Clatterbuck  END

BEGIN HERE And one token proposal story from a groom (and, in true guy fashion, it's a list)... END
BEGIN HERE 1. How we met: Kait and I met on the first day of college. I was an international student and we both came early to orientation. She was one of the only people sitting in my section and we were friends from day one. We were also in 2 freshman classes together. She was my first friend in college! However, we started dating only in sophomore year. We transitioned from friends to boyfriend and girlfriend (and best friends) and finally to this stage! END
BEGIN HERE 2. When I realized I wanted to spend my life with her: I don't think there was one clear moment - it was a build up. She's a very private person. It took time to peel through all the beautiful layers she had. Once I was on the inside though, it was crystal clear. When you can be your true self without even thinking of feeling judged, that's when I knew. END
BEGIN HERE 3. How I chose that location and the day of the proposal: I wanted that day to be special, hence Hawaii. Our parents and my sister flew in from NJ and India (my family is based in India) because the both of us are very close to our families, and also because I wanted to share this special day and trip with them. Our families had all met before on different vacations we planned together, so Kait thought this was just another fun family vacation with both families. I had told both families that I'd be proposing, and when I got the green light I started looking for a photographer. Kait is a blogger and I knew she'd want an engagement shoot. But I wanted to capture the raw moment. Not anything planned. I found Anna Kim's website and I was sold. She put me on to her associate, Ajja and Ajja told me about Po'olenalena beach. I saw pictures and I knew that was the spot. But there was another problem. I had a feeling Kait knew I was going to propose this trip. That's one disadvantage of knowing someone so well. She knew that I was going to propose and I knew that she knew I was going to. So I had to change my whole plan. What I told Kait, since she's a blogger, was that I found a photographer would like to meet us and do a few test shoots of us that she could use for her blog. Her blog is "Blonde Expeditions" after all, and Maui is a pretty big expedition. So a shoot of mostly her, and a few of me in the mix would add some expedition-ness to her blog. She bought it. What I told Ajja was that Kait thinks it's a blog shoot, but that I was going to propose during the shoot and catch her off guard and surprise her. We did a few blog shoots of her, and the both of us, before I gave Ajja my cue. A few hours earlier I made up something along the lines of my stomach was hurting because Kait thought I looked nervous. So I went along with it. I bent down "in pain" and when I got up I had the ring ready. Cheesy, but it I didn't improvise she would have caught on. It worked perfectly. So even thought she knew I was going to propose during the trip, I made sure she didn't know exactly when, and it worked. Ajja was able to capture the exact, real moment, which is just beautiful. Words to live by – if you make her cry out of joy, you did a good job! END
BEGIN HERE 4. How I felt? Nerves the entire day. Not because I was going to ask her to marry me – that was the easy part. Nervous because I wanted everything to go perfectly and not ruin the surprise. Good thing I thought of stomach pain to mask the nervousness. I even said "maybe we should reschedule" to make it more real, but she asked me to "suck it up." — Armaan END

We can already hear the wedding bells. END
BEGIN HERE So because we can't contain our excitement around another possible Rodgers' wedding (helloooo Aaron and Olivia Munn, just get engaged already!), we'll start off with Jordan's super sweet entry to ABC for The Bachelorette season 12. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Courtesy of ABC News    END
BEGIN HERE "There's a lot to like about this contestant, and not just because a hometown date with him could include interviews with his older brother, Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers," ABC News wrote. "He gave a clever answer to the TMI-baiting question, 'What's the wildest thing you've done in the bedroom?' ('Try to hang a TV on the wall without directions or a stud finder,' he wrote). Rather than brag about his famous sibling, he gushed about how much he loves his grandparents. 'They broke the mold after their generation. They are the most loving people and best example of love and selflessness,' he wrote." END

He brought it up twice in his bio, writing that he doesn't have a tattoo for the 'same reason you don't put stickers on a 'Lambo' and that he's 'very comfortable' wearing swimwear in public because 'why have a 'Lambo' if you park it in the garage?' He doesn't like to be embarrassed on dates, and the worst, he wrote, is when a woman doesn't look as good in person as she does in photos." END

BEGIN HERE Every person's dream proposal is different. Some want a total surprise, from the general timeline to the ring itself, some want a big event (think flashmob or surprise engagement party), some want something totally private, and others want to be involved in every detail. And while that last category is probably the least traditional, it's becoming more and more common. So exactly how involved can you be in your own proposal? Our experts weigh in. END
BEGIN HERE If an out-of-left-field surprise proposal isn't quite what you'd hoped for, fear not! There are plenty of ways you can be involved, from subtle hints to deciding to pop the question yourself. END
BEGIN HERE The first thing to do is talk to you soon-to-be fiancé about what he or she is hoping for. Do they really want to plan a special surprise when you least expect it? Now's the time to talk about the details you really care about — whether that means shopping for the ring together or setting guidelines about the type of proposal you don't want. END
BEGIN HERE If they're open to ideas and suggestions, talk about the type of day you'd like to share. Leave room for a few surprises, but you could do anything from create a general idea to picking out exactly which restaurant the two of you would like to go to for your engagement dinner. Is there something you'd love to be wearing, or have you always dreamed of having a photographer capture the whole thing? Now's the time to make sure that dress is dry-cleaned, or to hint about the pro you'd love to have hiding in the bushes when the question is popped. END
BEGIN HERE And of course, there's always the option of both proposing! Pick a day, then split it in half — one of you has the morning to plan and pop the question, and the other will do so in the afternoon, all capped off with either a private dinner or a party with your friends. Buy rings for one another, line up a few sweet surprises, and cherish the fact that you're really deciding to marry each other. END

BEGIN HERE Well, hopefully not red wedding bells, but these two are so smitten' that we're already imagining their "I do's!" Ever since Game of Thrones' Kit Harington and Rose Leslie — who also used to star on the HBO fantasy drama — went public with their relationship last month, we've been obsessing over the too-cute couple even though, like Jon Snow, we know practically nothing. The twosome has remained infamously tight-lipped on their romantic relationship in the past, but Harington just recently spilled about the early days of their romance. And the man seriously has us swooning. END
BEGIN HERE Leslie and Harington were first linked way back in 2012 when they hit the London red carpet together and were spotted sporting some serious PDA, but have only just confirmed their relationship publicly. The Game of Thrones actors met when Leslie's character was introduced in season two, and filming the show in painfully beautiful Iceland proved to definitely warm up their romance. In fact, their time spent there is Harington's favorite memory of the series thus far, the actor revealed. END

BEGIN HERE Don't like to fly? Or have relatives who can't go that far due to health concerns, etc.? That doesn't mean that you can't have an island wedding, it just means you need to choose something connected to the mainland by ferries or bridges.

Now it's a gorgeous landmark, open to the public, where you can get married in historic gardens and dance the night away in a grandiose ballroom. Some of your guests can stay in hotel rooms with turrets, making the entire experience like something from another century, while still providing all the modern conveniences. Plus, there's a beautiful private beach a short shuttle ride away if you get married there when the weather is nice (eight months out of the year). END
BEGIN HERE There is more to the Florida Keys than Key West, and there are lots of less-commercialized spots throughout those islands where beautiful tropical weddings can be had without leaving the state.

BEGIN HERE After an online dating site first matched Anna Kohler with Dov Kesten on September 1, 2011, it didn't take her long to learn that he is the type of man who loves surprises. Three years later, in January of 2014, Dov came home with a few: He gave Anna two bouquets of roses and tulips before getting down on one knee and asking her to be his wife. As if that wasn't shocking enough for the elated bride-to-be, Dov had a few more tricks up his sleeve. After the couple shared a celebratory dinner, the groom-to-be revealed that the bride's parents had flown in from Florida and Minnesota and were waiting to share in the excitement. But the surprises didn't end there. He had also planned an impromptu engagement party with a crowd of their closest friends nearby. END
BEGIN HERE Although the couple lives in New York City, they knew they wanted to tie the knot in Minneapolis, Minnesota, so Anna teamed up with local wedding planner Amy Zaroff Events + Designs to coordinate a flower-focused party at the Depot Renaissance on June 13, 2015. The details of their timeless, romantic, and the flower-filled wedding day were captured by La de Da Photography. END

"I wanted our guests to feel like they were stepping into a floral garden," Anna says. So the couple introduced their flowering vision in their wedding invitations, created by Red Bliss Design. The elegant white, blush, and gold suite was finished with either a bright floral liner or a chic foil interpretation of the same pattern. END
BEGIN HERE Despite their Minneapolis wedding venue, the couple wasn't ready to leave the Big Apple entirely behind, so they chose to bring a New York City vibe to their midwest bash. And it was all-too-easy considering the Depot Renaissance had once been a train station.

Will your Uncle Barry and Aunt Enid be able to get through the reception without killing each other? You may not believe this, but your fiancé is nervous too. Sure, he's playing it all calm and unruffled, but there are plenty of worries simmering just below the surface. One of the biggest is: Are my friends going to make complete fools of themselves at the reception? END
BEGIN HERE You see, your fiancé knows his buds. He's seen them drunk, high, on the prowl in bars. He knows the short-sighted, under-handed and sometimes plain crazy things they'll do in order to get laid. His single friends might see the wedding as a golden opportunity to score, and will be eyeing all of the eligible women there — whether it's your sister, one of your bridesmaids, one of your cousins, even your sexy aunt. A wedding is a romantic affair in which everyone gets riled up and ready to go. Add music and booze, and the odds of hooking up go through the roof. END

But there are ways to show your affection that won't make your guests gag, and our experts are here to give nine recommendations. END
BEGIN HERE   A first look isn't for every couple. But consider this: "A first look allows the two of you to be as emotional as you would like when you see each other for the first time," says Glick.

Then, when you see each other during the ceremony, you'll still definitely have a moment, but it won't be anything over the top and will keep your guests smiling." END

BEGIN HERE All eyes are usually on the bride, but at the recent wedding of NFL star Devon Still and his longtime love Asha Joyce, it was the flower girl who totally stole the show! The wedding had been postponed when Still's six-year-old daughter, Leah, had been diagnosed with stage four cancer, but after successfully beating the disease in March 2015, the little girl was finally able to walk down the aisle with her proud dad and new step-mom. And boy, did she look adorable while doing it! Can't say that we're surprised — after kicking cancer's butt, flower girl duties have got to be a piece of (wedding) cake, right? END
BEGIN HERE "We put off the wedding because my daughter was battling cancer. Now that [the wedding] is officially here, it's the beginning of our future and the end to a hard time," the Houston Texans football player told People of his Friday night Manhattan nupitals. "When I saw [Leah] even before the wedding, I got emotional. We'd been waiting for this moment for a long time." It's understandable why the groom's tears were flowing. Leah was simply beautiful in her pale pink tulle flower girl dress, that complemented the bride's three (yup, three!) wedding day looks: A lace mermaid Pnina Tornai, a champagne ruffled gown by Allure, and a tulle Allison Parris dress. With a wedding venue as iconic as the New York City Public Library, it's go big or go home! END
BEGIN HERE 180 guests filled the Manhattan landmark for the ceremony, which boasted hundreds of white candles and too-sweet vows from the couple. "We made it through the storm. We made it through hell," Still told his bride, with Leah standing beside him crying tears of joy. "I love my new family," the flower girl later told the wedding guests. We're not crying — you're crying... END
BEGIN HERE The new family of three later celebrated on the reception dance floor, where they performed a groovy dance together to "Uptown Funk." "I really only had to practice for like one hour," explained Leah. "But my dad had to practice a lot longer." Told you this little munchkin stole the show! END

But before you wave off this duo as a pair of budget-friendly fanatics, just wait until you read their oh-so-cayute story. END
BEGIN HERE "Anyone who knows Dan and I knows how much we love Costco," the bride-to-be, Karinne Tarshish, told ABC News. "We just like good deals, and we both like Costco as a company. I will say that my family is pretty gung-ho about Costco. We generally get everything there." END

But Sherman was certainly up to the challenge, and my oh my did she deliver. END

BEGIN HERE When picking a dress code for your wedding, there are a lot of details to consider. You'll want to keep in mind the décor you've chosen, the venue, how you'll be serving the meal, and the overall vibe you're hoping to create (so you're not asking guests in tuxedos to heat saucy ribs or encouraging sundresses when your aisle is the state capitol's marble staircase). Another thing to think about is the time of day. If you're inviting guests to a morning or early afternoon celebration, can your wedding be a formal black-tie affair? Our experts weigh in. END
BEGIN HERE While nothing is stopping you from having a formal wedding at 10 in the morning, traditional etiquette states that you can't actually ask your male guests to don black tie attire. In fact, some experts will tell you that you shouldn't wear a tuxedo at all before 6 p.m.! END
BEGIN HERE If you're getting married in the morning and want something especially formal, opt for traditional morning dress, which, for the guys, combines a vest and a cutaway coat (with longer tails that almost reach the knees) and dark pin-striped pants. The top hat is optional, but you might want to include them in the groom and groomsmen's attire. END
BEGIN HERE For something slightly less traditional, the men could wear morning suits (an all-gray version of the above morning vest), or a charcoal gray suit and vest. Having a semi-formal morning or early afternoon wedding? A regular suit in black or dark gray will set the tone, without getting all the way dressed up in a tuxedo. END
BEGIN HERE When it comes to women's attire, tradition states that women shouldn't wear full-length gowns before the evening (aside from the bride, of course!). Invite women to wear formal tea-length dresses or a pretty-colored suit, with either a skirt or pants. An early afternoon wedding may specify cocktail attire, and the closer it is to 6 p.m., the more acceptable a long gown will be. END

BEGIN HERE   While Bloom isn't with Selena Gomez, he is "With Her." The couple was spotted together at a Hillary Clinton rally in NYC. Bloom was there supporting Perry, who was performing during the event. She signed autographs and posed for pictures, rocking a vibrant shirt that read, "Hillary Clinton is a badass." An insider shared, "Katy and Orlando had a quick trip to New York City. Orlando came to support Katy and he is also a big Hillary Clinton fan," Us Weekly reports. END

BEGIN HERE Springtime is finally here and summer's right around the corner. That means sunshine, gorgeous blooms, and of course warm-weather weddings. We can smell the sweet scent of peonies, and hear all those "I dos" already... We can't help but get inspired by all the pretty petals and greenery this time of year and want to sprinkle it everywhere from the table settings to the cake confections — and of course incorporate it into some pretty spectacular bridal beauty looks. A favorite of ours at the moment? Floral hairpins blooming straight out of your luxe locks. It doesn't get much more summertime chic as far as wedding hair goes. END
BEGIN HERE Some brides steal a little bridal beauty inspo from their beautiful bouquet and opt for a flower crown to complete their look. And, while we love their boho bridal style, others are on the hunt for something a little more formal but just as fabulously feminine. That's why we're head over heels for these fancy floral hairpins. Blingy and beautiful, these embellished accessories can totally elevate your wedding day look, taking it from simplistic chic to simply sparkling. END
BEGIN HERE Pop just one or two gilded flower pins into your updo for a subtly stunning look, or scatter dozens of glitzy clips throughout your tresses for a more glamorous bridal style. We also love these tiny blooms in half-up half-down hairstyles for an effortlessly feminine, summertime-appropriate look. END
BEGIN HERE In an age where it seems like nearly everyone meets on a dating app, Diana Kirschner and Michael Haddad have a story that stands out: Diana's dog introduced them. Yes, you read that right! As Diana walked her rescue pooch through New York City's Upper West Side, the four-legged lady stopped in front of Michael, giving the pair the perfect chance to check one another out. "We had an old-fashioned meet-cute," Diana says. Two years later, when Diana and Michael took that same dog for a walk through Central Park, Michael got down on one knee and proposed. END
BEGIN HERE Considering where Michael popped the question, it's only appropriate the pair chose The Loeb Boathouse in Central Park for the site of their October 25, 2015, wedding. In fact, the Boathouse was the only place the future Mr. and Mrs. even looked. "Central Park is where we walk and run our dog every day, and the choice was obvious," the bride says. And with the help of Andrea Freeman Events, the couple planned an elegant fall wedding with a hint of rustic flair, captured beautifully by Sara Wight Photography.  END

BEGIN HERE Diana drew inspiration for her wedding dress from a seemingly unlikely source: An old Tiffany & Co. commercial, in which a bride and groom walk down New York City's 72nd Street promenade toward Central Park. What stood out most to Diana was that the bride was dressed in truly stunning gown. "I tried to track down as much information as I could online," she says, but she later learned the TV bride's dress was an unattainable vintage Prada. But Diana wasn't ready to give up yet, hoping to find a modern style with a similar aesthetic. "I sent the commercial to some friends and three of them said it looked like something Jenny Packham would make." END
BEGIN HERE With that information in hand, Diana headed to the designer's New York City store. Once there, it didn't take the bride long to find a look that felt as sophisticated as the one she had been eyeing. Diana walked out with the second dress she tried on, an ivory sheath with delicate beading. "The whole process probably took 20 minutes," she says. END
BEGIN HERE The bride completed her elegant updo with a meaningful family heirloom. "I wore a pin that belonged to my maternal grandmother who is no longer with us," Diana explains. "She was a very classy lady, and it was a beautiful piece of antique jewelry." END

BEGIN HERE The couple chose not to have a wedding party, but they did ask Diana's 18-month-old nephew to serve as their ring bearer. But since he was so young, the bride and groom knew he likely wouldn't make it down the aisle on his own. "The plan was to have him walk with his parents," Diana says. "Unfortunately, the ceremony was right around a nap time and he was starting to crash. He only made it down the aisle being carried by my brother and carrying his special stuffed animal." END

BEGIN HERE There are nearly endless options for weddings. Formal or relaxed? Religious or secular? Summer or winter? The way you and your fiancé choose to celebrate is totally up to you. Whether you're saving up for a big expense (like an incredible vacation or a new house) or would rather not be the center of attention, having a wedding at City Hall is becoming more and more popular, even for couples who don't want to elope. But Friday and Saturday afternoon are some of the busiest times to pop in and get hitched, even if your local option takes appointments in advance, meaning a lot of these weddings occur mid-week — and even mid-workday. So if you're planning to have a few guests along, can you ask them to take time off to join you downtown? Here's what our experts think. END
BEGIN HERE Most states require a witness or two at your marriage, so you'll definitely need to ask a friend or family member to take the day off to join you for your ceremony (that is, of course, unless you're totally happy with a stranger waiting in the DMV line signing your marriage license!). END
BEGIN HERE When it comes to other friends, think about the scale and timing of your celebration. Are you getting married first thing in the morning, followed by brunch at your favorite restaurant? See if your guests can take a half day and head to work in the afternoon — armed with a really great answer to the "Where were you this morning?" questions! END
BEGIN HERE If you're aiming to wed in the afternoon and then go out to dinner to celebrate, you could ask guests to leave work early, or head to City Hall with just your witnesses and have friends join you for a restaurant reception once they're out of work. END
BEGIN HERE For the couple that's hoping to spend the day celebrating, keep in mind that some guests might not be able to take an entire day off of work. In this case, you might want to keep your actual wedding day very intimate, and then plan a weekend celebration for guests who couldn't get out of the conference room on Tuesday. Any reason to celebrate again, right? END
BEGIN HERE  We Want a Simple Courthouse Ceremony, But Our Parents Object. What Can We Do to Appease Them? END
BEGIN HERE You don't have to leave the country to have a Caribbean wedding. As the popularity of destination weddings grows, the availability of different wedding options in the U.S. Virgin Islands has increased dramatically, too. Where once there were only a few venue options, and one wedding planner per island, now brides and grooms have huge lists of vendors to choose from, and every hotel and resort — in literally every price point — offers wedding packages and group discounts for guests. END
BEGIN HERE First and foremost, these little tropical gems located just east of Puerto Rico, are part of the United States. Therefore, your guests do not need passports to travel to them. While guests may be required to show a birth certificate to Customs as proof of citizenship, along with a driver's license, this can be an advantage if few of your friends are seasoned travelers and would need to get passports for the sole purpose of attending your wedding. END
BEGIN HERE You can get direct flights from many major cities to St. Croix and St. Thomas, and St. John is just a ferry ride away from St. Thomas. Once you arrive, there's no sales tax, making shopping a major activity for your guests. And since the islands are part of the United States, dollars are the currency of choice. END
BEGIN HERE St. Thomas has literally hundreds of shops geared toward the preferences of tourists, and they cater to hundreds of thousands of cruise ship guests a year, in addition to visitors staying on the island. There are major boutique chains represented, as well as local shops featuring island goods. More than one bride and groom have waited to buy pricey wedding bands the week they arrive on the island for their wedding, and saved a lot of money. END
BEGIN HERE St. Croix is the comeback kid, having reinvented itself over the last 15 years, and once again, becoming a popular cruise ship port. While there's not a whole lot for tourists to do or see on the west end in Frederiksted, there's shopping, restaurants, a marina, and a boardwalk in Christiansted which offer plenty of entertainment. While many of the same chain stores in St. Thomas have a location on St. Croix, it's the fantastic local shops that are really worth a visit. One couple gifted all of their wedding party with the famous Cruzan hook bracelets, from the alleged original creator of them, Sonya Ltd. END
BEGIN HERE  Caribbean Honeymoon Destinations for Every Type of Couple END
BEGIN HERE St. John feels far more remote, and is much less commercialized, than St. Thomas and St. Croix, but it takes a little more effort to get there, and weddings tend to be more expensive than on the other islands. Also, there are fewer vendor options, meaning that if you want a photographer or music that isn't locally available, you'll have to pay travel and accommodations on top of their regular fees. END

BEGIN HERE They haven't tied the knot yet, but these two are already newlywed nesting! Engaged lovebirds Anna Camp and Skylar Astin just purchased a Los Feliz, California house together that'll soon (very soon, we hope!) become their marital home. And by the sound of it, this place is — we have to say it... — Pitch Perfect! END
BEGIN HERE We still can't aca-believe it that these two Pitch Perfect co-stars are getting married, but as those wedding day details continue to fall into place, it's all getting more and more aca-awesome. "We're thinking different shades of pinks and peach, and also a lot of ivory and greenery," Camp previously said of her nuptials plans. "I want the colors to feel very nature-friendly, but very vibrant and lively." Wedding colors? Check! Venue? Another check! (Camp and her hubby-to-be recently fell in love with a swoon-worthy outdoor venue in California.) Next on the list is our favorite — wedding dress shopping! And it looks like that particularly pretty process is already well underway for Camp. Back in February, the actress posted an Instagram snapshot (below) of herself and a gal pal in a bridal boutique, trying on some frothy tulle confections. (We're really feeling the blush ballgown, Anna...) So with most of the wedding day details in place, what's there left to do? Well, if you're these two movie stars, buy a $1.98 million house, of course. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Giphy    END
BEGIN HERE The 1920's Spanish-style home Camp and Astin just purchased is basically the newlywed nest of your dreams. The L.A. Times reports that it features a gated courtyard full of gorgeous gardens, trees, and fountains. The arched front door opens into rolled ceilings, Palladian windows, tiled fireplaces, and floor-to-ceiling bookcases. Oh, and there's built-in wine storage in the kitchen. Again, we have to say it... END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Giphy    END
BEGIN HERE As for the soon-to-be wedded twosome's bedroom, the master suite is its own entire wing and features french doors that open onto a swimming pool. And in case any of their other Pitch Perfect co-stars need a place to crash after the "I do's," they can rest their heads in the four-bedroom guest house. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Giphy    END

BEGIN HERE Nobody wants to be that wedding guest — you know the one, the had-one-too-many-drinks cousin who ends up jumping in the pool at the reception, or the oh-so-awkward best man who spends his whole wedding toast talking about his failed relationships. Yeah, no one wants to be that guest. But, turns out, even the most well-behaved wedding guests can make minor missteps in their journey as an attendee. Being invited to someone's wedding is a big honor, and you don't want to offend the bride, groom or their families with some silly little faux pas. Luckily, we tapped Sharon Schweitzer, international etiquette expert, author and founder and CEO of Protocol & Etiquette Worldwide, for her expert tips on the major etiquette mistakes to avoid. So listen up, wedding guests! END
BEGIN HERE   Maybe you think the bride throwing her bouquet is a silly tradition. Maybe you don't like the wedding colors. Maybe you think the ceremony was too long and religious. Whatever the case, refrain from making negative comments or not participating. This is not your day and it's not about you. END
BEGIN HERE Marriage isn't always as easy as happily ever after. In reality, committing yourself to someone for the rest of your life can come with plenty of surprises, both delightful and less than pleasant. And sometimes, there's so much pressure to seem blissed-out that it's hard for people to, as The Real World says, stop being polite and start getting real. Here, 12 women open up about what they really wish they'd known before walking down the aisle. END
BEGIN HERE  21 Things You Deserve In A Relationship END
BEGIN HERE Consider it the secret celebrity wedding that started it all. But is it really any surprise that the King of Pop and the daughter of the King of Rock began a trend when they said "I do?" Nearly 22 years after Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley wed in a top-secret ceremony in the Dominican Republic, celebs everywhere are still sneakily tying the knot. (We're looking at you Jen and Justin, Ashton and Mila, Angelina and Brad...) But today, we're throwing it back to the original secretive stars and their memorable 1994 nuptials. END
BEGIN HERE The couple first met when Presley was just seven-years-old, tagging along with her famous dad to Jackson's Las Vegas concerts. The pair picked up their friendship many years later in 1992, according to People, and two years after that, the ruler of Neverland and the heiress of Graceland met in holy matrimony. END
BEGIN HERE Presley is now a little iffy on how the King of Pop popped the question. In a 2010 interview with Oprah Winfrey, she said that Jackson got down on one knee in the library of Neverland Ranch. However, she also told Diane Sawyer that Jackson asked her to marry him over the phone. (You really can't remember, Presley?! Seriously?!) Luckily, their wedding day details are a little more well-documented. END
BEGIN HERE Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Getty Images    END
BEGIN HERE While vacationing in the Dominican Republic, Jackson and Presley drove in a white minivan to the house of a local judge on May 26, 1994, paid a small fee, and tied the knot. "Do you take this woman to be your wife?" the officiant asked the groom. "Why not?" Jackson reportedly replied. What a smooth ~~criminal~~ groom... END
BEGIN HERE 15 minutes later and the world's most popular singer and the daughter of rock 'n roll were officially hitched. A Dominican newspaper soon leaked the story, as the newlyweds tried to keep the nuptials under wraps from the public and even their families. The union wasn't without its scandal, after all — Presley had divorced her first husband just 20 days before marrying her second! END
BEGIN HERE Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Getty Images    END
BEGIN HERE But as badly as we wanted to see photos of Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux's "I do's" (we're still waiting...), people were just as desperate for the scoop on Jackson and Presley's. The signatures on their leaked marriage license were analyzed, the paparazzi were prowling, and the couple had to hole up in a newlywed nest in Trump Tower. (The Donald later bragged that he knew their secret all along, of course.) END
BEGIN HERE Finally on August 1, the famous twosome issued a statement confirming their happily married status. "My married name is Mrs. Lisa Marie Presley-Jackson," the pop princess told the media. "My marriage to Michael Jackson took place in a private ceremony outside the United States weeks ago... I am very much in love with Michael, I dedicate my life to being his wife." The pair was officially public, even sharing an infamously over-the-top kiss at the MTV Video Music Awards that year. END

"I was totally shocked!" remembers Elle. "Alex said he wanted to do a couple's photo shoot on the beach, and that he had built a set for the occasion. He wrote me a song (he's a musician), which was about marrying me, and then he proposed!" Ugh, too cute! END

BEGIN HERE Catherine Lowe (formerly Catherine Giudici) is rocking some new bling! The wife of former Bachelor Sean Lowe, who received his final rose on the legendary ABC series' seventeenth season, has been showing off a new rock on that finger in lieu of her usual engagement ring, and, we've gotta admit, we're loving the expectant mom's new unique sparkler. END
BEGIN HERE Our friends over at Glamour first noticed the new rock on the former Bachelor contestant's Instagram page (way to sleuth, guys!). Catherine, who is 33 weeks pregnant, has forgone her Neil Lane cushion-cut diamond in a split shank halo setting (you know, the one that her hubby gave her during their ultra-romantic televised proposal) for a slightly roomier ring. END
BEGIN HERE Turns out, pregnancy is really getting to Catherine's extremities and, as she revealed in an Instagram post, her Neil Lane engagement and wedding rings are just too small for her mommy-to-be fingers. Her caption reads: "Rockin' a new one. (Mah fingas are growing too much for my 4 1/2 size Neil Lane) #pregprobs" END
BEGIN HERE Hey, an upgrade is an upgrade! Even if it's because your fingers have gotten a bit too swollen. END
BEGIN HERE And might we just say, we are LOVING Catherine's temporary bling — it's so unique! The sparkler is by Blaine Bowen and, according to Glamour, it won't be available on her site until June 1. The crystal appears to be quartz, which, according to Blaine Bowen, represents power, energy and clarity. END
BEGIN HERE Here's our big question: Will the mommy-to-be rock BOTH sparklers after she's given birth to the little Lowe and her fingers have reduced to their normal size? We certainly hope so. See the photos of both rings below! END
BEGIN HERE It seems like just yesterday we were watching Sean and Catherine tie the knot in a stunning and romantic (and televised) wedding ceremony on the network almost two years ago. After a blissful honeymoon in Bora Bora, SeanCat (as they are affectionately called) have been enjoying married life in Dallas ever since. END
BEGIN HERE Famed for his waiting-until-marriage endurance, Sean had been living separately from his bride-to-be until they wed in 2014. Even during his Dancing With the Stars stint, the pair lived next door to each other in the same building due to his beliefs that they should wait until they were legally married to have sex. The expecting couple was most recently featured on We TV's Marriage Boot Camp, along with other reality stars such as Here Comes Honey Boo Boo's "Mama" June Shannon and Mike "Sugar Bear" Thompson. END
BEGIN HERE You may know the Natasha Bedingfield theme song by heart (and belt it out whenever a rare rerun graces MTV), but did you know what was going on behind the scenes of The Hills' iconic wedding episode, where Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag tied the knot? Nope, didn't think so! We speak from experience when we say that the behind-the-scenes action of any wedding can be chaotic and crazy. Couple that with reality TV and you've got a recipe for some serious "I do" drama... Lauren Conrad just spilled all the deets behind the 2009 Speidi ceremony — including what lead to a producer locking her in a basement. Wait, what?! END
BEGIN HERE If you were a fan of the early 2000's MTV staple (and let's be real here, who wasn't?), then you know about the infamous feud the show's two stars got into when Montag began dating Pratt. To put it lightly, Montag's former BFF Lauren Conrad was not a fan of the guy. But who know that the frenemy feud (and some backstage producer drama) would lead to Conrad throwing a fit on Montag's big day! END
BEGIN HERE The wedding episode marked Conrad's last appearance on the show, after she felt almost forced to participate in the nuptials and was forbidden to leave by producers. The former reality show star claims that she needed to leave the wedding to attend another event, when every bride's worst nightmare occurred. The power went out, bringing Montag and Pratt's big day to a grinding halt. END

BEGIN HERE "The power went out, the generator went out and I said, 'I need to leave!'" Conrad recently told Us Weekly. "And [producers] wouldn't let me leave!" she remembers. "They literally locked me in the basement with two security guards and wouldn't let me leave! And I was like, 'You can't keep me here!' I was throwing a fit!" END
BEGIN HERE Two hours later, the lights were back on and so were the "I do's." But as soon as those vows were exchanged, Conrad was out the door — without so much as a congratulations to the bride and groom. (Majorly rude, Conrad!) "At that point, this wasn't really my life anymore, and I left out the [church's] side door," explained Conrad. END

BEGIN HERE  Lauren Conrad Reveals the Best Wedding Favor She's Ever Gotten END
BEGIN HERE Including family and friends in your wedding ceremony is a great way to honor the people you care about. If they're not already groomsmen, brothers can make great ushers, perfect for escorting Grandma to her seat and helping guests navigate which side of the aisle they should sit on. But what if your college-aged brother is rocking a college-appropriate haircut and beard that isn't his most groomed look? Our experts weigh in on whether you can ask him to get a trim. END
BEGIN HERE Before you get to the point of demanding that he get a haircut, think back to your last major family event. Did he head to the barber a few days before and make sure his beard was in check? Then you're probably in luck and he may very well have an appointment scheduled for the week before your wedding — especially if his girlfriend is great at reminding him to shave!  END
BEGIN HERE If you're still not convinced, ask the aforementioned girlfriend, your mom, or his best friend to drop a hint or two. Let him know how great he looks when his mane has been nicely maintained. This doesn't mean asking him to totally shave off his lumberjack beard, but instead to trim or groom it so that it looks neat. END
BEGIN HERE But remember, asking your perpetually bearded brother to groom his facial hair is not an excuse to demand that he change his look entirely. Is it reasonable to request that his hair be well-washed, combed, and relatively managed? Yes. But insisting that he go from a man-bun or a goatee to a crew cut and a clean shave is a big no-no. Chances are he'll want to look his best, both at your wedding and in photos, so give him the benefit of the doubt — and have an extra comb or some mustache wax on-hand on your wedding day, just in case. END
BEGIN HERE  Exactly When to Schedule Your Pre-Wedding Beauty Appointments END
BEGIN HERE Whether or not you're the one handing over the funds for the wedding of your dreams, you will find that putting together a wedding costs more than you thought or even set a budget for when you first got engaged. So while you're in the middle of picking and choosing what you want and what you need for your wedding day, you may want to get a head start on also making plans for your honeymoon. END
BEGIN HERE Perhaps there's a destination you've always imagined going to for your honeymoon or you've already started to put together an itinerary for the post-wedding trip of your dreams. Either way, the top question you may find yourself asking is: Can we ask our parents to pay for our honeymoon? END
BEGIN HERE Before you ask your folks to fund the trip of your dreams, map out an estimate of how much you think the trip will cost. If your parents are already paying for a chunk of your wedding, it may not be the best idea to ask them to shell out even more cash for your trip. But if you're paying for your wedding on your own, you could ask your parents if they would be willing to contribute to your honeymoon fund as your wedding gift. END
BEGIN HERE  Best Honeymoon Destinations By Month END
BEGIN HERE The other option you can consider, if you don't want to ask your parents to chip in for this expense, is to put a honeymoon fund on your registry. That way, guests can help pay for your honeymoon as their wedding gift to you, which, for some couples, beats getting a blender or a set of knives they don't need. If you want to break it down for your guests even more, certain honeymoon registries, like Zola, even let your guests pick and choose what part of your honeymoon they want to gift to you, whether it's airfare, hotel stays, or activities along the way.

But luckily, with our experts' advice, you can keep your sex life hot and a sex slump at bay. Here are seven tips to start. END
BEGIN HERE   Scheduled sex can still be hot. And keeping regular intimacy dates, even on a calendar, keep you from getting into a rut. "If times are overwhelming, acknowledge that your sex life is impacted — say it out loud," says Queen. "And talk about when you can get away from the bustle to make love. Hold each other when you get a chance. Use eye contact, intimate talk, words of love, and get each other through with a promise that you will really reconnect soon. Then keep the promise." END
BEGIN HERE There's no denying that Kristen Bell popularized the slow-moving sloth back in 2012 when she freaked the F out on Ellen about the long-clawed creature. Ever since, scores of Americans have become obsessed with the cute, albeit sometimes creepy, mammal that stole Bell's heart long ago. But if you're not one of these mega-sloth fans just yet (and yes, we're totally judging you if you're not), then we guarantee this epic proposal will change your mind entirely. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Giphy    END
BEGIN HERE Instead of popping the question on a horse-drawn carriage or at a romantic, candlelit dinner, Walter Mccann from Tampa, Florida had a way — and we mean WAY — better proposal idea in mind. On Wednesday, the soon-to-be fiancé took his girlfriend, Carly Corvin, to Busch Gardens where she got to meet her favorite furry creature in a private session with one of the theme park's employees. But Corvin had no idea what was to happen next after she was introduced to the park's famous two-toed sloth, Harry. END
BEGIN HERE In the video, Corvin literally cannot contain her excitement as she stands only feet away from Harry, who seems perfectly ~chill~ in this situation, as sloths generally do. The Busch Garden employee asks squealing Corvin if she'd like to feed Harry, to which of course she receives an excited, "Yes!" in response. Then the most magical thing happens — Mccann takes the top off of the hungry sloth's meal, and it reveals to his girlfriend a plate of vegetables that spells out "Will you marry me?" END
BEGIN HERE Ok, BRB SOBBING. END
BEGIN HERE Obviously Corvin exclaims yes, because we mean... SLOTH. PROPOSAL. How could anyone with a heart say no to that?! After the couple went from boyfriend and girlfriend to fianceés, they were greeted by their closest friends and family who were hiding in the wings to celebrate with them on this very special, very sloth-tastic day. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Giphy    END
BEGIN HERE "I told him before that if he proposed with a sloth, there was no way I could say, 'no,'" Corvin told Fox 13 News. "So, he took my good advice. This is literally the best day of my life!" END

"When I was first asked to do it, I said no I didn't want to do it," she said. "I was afraid I would make a mess and screw it up — you know, forget my lines." Regardless of what she ended up saying, we're hoping she included, "you 'meow' kiss the bride," because it would just be too punny. END
BEGIN HERE As for the cats, they were pretty relaxed and better-than-your-average wedding guests.

BEGIN HERE A destination wedding to sunny Mexico? Yes, please! Where's our invite, Eva?! This is really no surprise for the jetsetting couple. After all, the media mogul did surprise his bride with a romantic proposal in the middle of the Dubai desert! The patterned pillows, Persian rugs, the sand dunes... Sigh. That engagement (and the ruby red engagement ring that came with) was certainly one for the books. END
BEGIN HERE People reports that "half of hollywood" is expected to fly in for Longoria and Baston's "I do's," with the star-studded guest list including David and Victoria Beckham, Penelope Cruz, Ricky Martin, Katy Perry, Mario Lopez. Swanky, much? The ceremony is set to take place at Jane The Virgin actor Jaime Camil's home in Acapulco and the bride-to-be is already sharing snapshots of the swoon-worthy views (see below). END
BEGIN HERE As far as Longoria's bridal style is concerned, the Telenova star is set to be looking posh — with the help none other than Posh Spice, herself. Hello! magazine reports that Victoria Beckham has designed her BFF's wedding dress. Yes, we are quite jealous... The actress' bridal beauty prep work is already well underway. She recently shared a video of herself getting a wedding day mani by nail artist Kimmie Kyees, while simultaneously having her hair washed by hairstylist to the stars Ken Paves. Being a bride is hard work, y'all! END

BEGIN HERE  For a pair of book lovers, their wedding planner created a dessert-table backdrop out of books, with rolled up pages spelling out "Yum." END
BEGIN HERE In October of 2012, Elizabeth Gordon and Kenneth Sicard's mutual friends set the pair up on a blind date. "By the end of the night we both knew it was the start of something really special," Elizabeth remembers. "Kenny's sweet dance moves sealed the deal for me and he says my smile and jokes did it for him." As excited as they were about the prospects for a relationship, Elizabeth still had her doubts: At the time, she was battling cancer and caring for her daughter, Anslie, on her own. "I thought those sort of things would send a guy running for the hills," she says. But Kenny wasn't going anywhere and even told Elizabeth that the things she feared would drive him away only made him love her more. Three months later, she introduced Anslie and Kenny to each other and their instant bond was proof enough that he was here to stay. END
BEGIN HERE About a year and a half later, Kenny popped the question in the kitchen of their apartment. "Anslie ran into the room wondering what was going on," the bride says. "She then burst into tears, hugged us both, and said, 'This is the best day of my life!'" And it only got better for her: Kenny left the room and reappeared with another box, this time dropping to one knee to ask Anslie if he could be her step dad with a pair of earrings. END
BEGIN HERE The couple (and Anslie!) decided to officially become a family on October 3, 2015, at the Muscadine Vine in Powder Springs, Georgia. With a relaxed, natural, and ethereal aesthetic in mind, Elizabeth and Kenny invited 120 guests to watch them exchange vows and asked Julia Fenner of Leggy Bird to capture their gorgeous fall day. Even with less-than-perfect weather, this happy couple and their young daughter made it a day to remember. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Leggy Bird    END
BEGIN HERE "I cried the first time we checked out our venue," Elizabeth admits. "We referred to it as 'The Secret Garden.' It was every bit whimsical and breathtaking and we instantly knew it was where we were supposed to pledge our love and officially start our lives together." Although their October wedding date came with some unexpected rainy weather, it only proved to make the day that much more intimate and magical. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Leggy Bird    END
BEGIN HERE Elizabeth found her lace and chiffon wedding dress from Free People on a whim. "I was casually browsing their new bridal collection and I instantly knew this was the one," she says. "When my dress arrived, it felt like Christmas morning. After that, everything else started falling into place. My dress set the romantic tone for our wedding." END
BEGIN HERE Her fresh floral headpiece, which contained a mix of different flowers including hydrangeas, roses, and greenery, complemented Elizabeth's soft waves. Anslie coordinated with her mom by wearing a full flower crown, filled with lots of greenery and hydrangeas. The bride also donned a long veil handmade by her groom's aunt. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Leggy Bird    END
BEGIN HERE "We decided to go with very neutral colors for our wedding party," Elizabeth says, so she asked her bridesmaids to choose any cream-hued lace dress they loved. While the bride's bouquet featured lots of bright-hued blooms, including roses, hydrangeas, berries, and eucalyptus, her attendants carried arrangements comprised entirely of greenery. "They looked amazing with their cream dresses and the landscaping." END
BEGIN HERE When it came to Kenny's attire, he kept everything Southern classic, but with his own modern spin. He paired his blue Michael Kors suit with a traditional white button down and a vintage bow tie from Elizabeth. His groomsmen all wore khaki pants, white shirts, and tan suspenders. END
BEGIN HERE The family's first look was one of the most memorable parts of the day for Elizabeth, Kenny, and Anslie. Kenny stood beneath an oak tree with his back to his future wife and daughter, and the pair snuck up beneath a big umbrella. "We were giggling and failing to be quiet and sneaky," the bride remembers. "When we turned around and we saw one another for the first time... I can't put it into words." END
BEGIN HERE The three enjoyed some private time together, posing for photos and laughing as a family, before the celebration kicked off. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Leggy Bird    END
BEGIN HERE Anslie served as both the flower girl and ring bearer, toting a basket of greenery and lace and wearing the couple's wedding bands on a chain around her neck, over her heart. Musician Anna Kate Gill played guitar and sang for the ceremony. Elizabeth and her father walked down the aisle to a live rendition of Jack Johnson's "Angel." END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Leggy Bird    END
BEGIN HERE Although their ceremony was initially meant to be outside, rainy weather meant the reception barn had to serve double duty. Elizabeth's step dad officiated, making the personalized ceremony that much more special for the bride and groom. "It was a really special way of incorporating him into our wedding festivities," she says. "Reading our vows to one another with all of our loved ones surrounding us was magical. We pledged our love in the barn with the rain beating down on the tin roof. It was so intimate and romantic." END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Leggy Bird    END
BEGIN HERE The reception featured a collection of antique and eclectic furniture, including mismatched farm tables and a claw foot tub that was repurposed to hold bottles of cold beer. The bride and groom's sweetheart table was decorated with an old wooden trunk and Elizabeth's bold bouquet. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Leggy Bird    END
BEGIN HERE For dinner, the couple brought in a local favorite: Sweet Auburn BBQ dished out southern staples like pulled pork, pulled chicken, boracho, baked beans, mac and cheese, Texas toast, and cornbread. END
BEGIN HERE The meal closed out with an assortment of cupcakes, arranged on an antique shelf. Flavors like chocolate, cookies and cream, red velvet, chocolate cream, blueberry crumble, strawberry, key lime pie, and almond wedding cake meant there was something for everyone to enjoy during dessert. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Leggy Bird    END
BEGIN HERE Elizabeth and Kenny shared their first dance to "Coming Home" by Leon Bridges before bringing their daughter out onto the dance floor with them. "Then, we danced the night away under the twinkling lights, barefoot until my dress turned brown," the bride says. "We loved around and only saw happy faces full of love and laughter." END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Leggy Bird    END
BEGIN HERE Although they planned a honeymoon in the Bahamas for early 2016, Elizabeth and Kenny enjoyed a little alone time following their fall nuptials. "The day after the wedding we packed up and headed to our family cabin in the mountains. The first night we made a fire, ate a frozen pizza, drank champagne, and read our cards and guest book. Reflecting on our big day together in that setting was cozy and perfect." END

Fiancés of the world, take note. END
BEGIN HERE The R&B singer and the football star announced their engagement back in March with a selfie-style video. "She said yes! Yeah!" Russell excitedly states in the film. "Making this thing happen. My baby." Completely beaming, Ciara pipes in,"Yay! I'm so excited!" And so are we! Ever since the too-cute couple released their proposal video and debuted the bride-to-be's killer diamond engagement ring, we've been dying to see how their sure-to-be-beautiful nuptials start to shape up. And although, we are still without an official wedding day update, Wilson just shared with the world his feelings for his soon-to-be wife and 2-year-old soon-to-be stepson, Future Zahir. And with words this sweet, they'll definitely hold us over for now! END
BEGIN HERE When Ciara Instagrammed a stunning snapshot of herself cradling her little one, Wilson couldn't help but let loose with a flood of love for the pair, writing in the comments, "Watching him grow over the past year and a half has been the most fulfilling and special things I've ever been around."

He is so blessed to have you hold him and hug him and love him with so much pure and real love that he will have no limits to what God has in store for him." END

BEGIN HERE One of the best parts of your wedding day other than you know, getting married and all — is being surrounded by your closest friends and family, all in one place, all at one time. But for some couples, their nuptials simply wouldn't be complete without their furry friend in tow, which is exactly why we at BRIDES made this squeal-worthy video of puppies and dogs from all walks of life sharing in the joy of their parents' big day. They're not called man's best friend for nothing, after all! END

More and more brides-to-be are strapping bow ties or tuxedo vests onto their cuddly pals for some over-the-top CUTE wedding photos that will last a lifetime. Plus, the pics make for some killer Instagram/Facebook photos. But some brides are a little lost as to what exactly their pup can do in the wedding other than drool all over that one aunt (you know the one) who gets on their nerves. Much to many of our readers' surprise though, there are tons of cute ways to get your furball involved on the big day! END

BEGIN HERE Every bride dreads the idea of trimming loved ones off the wedding guest list. It becomes even more impossible-seeming if you both come from large families and are blessed to have a big group of friends. But if you and your guy dream of having a small, intimate wedding, it's an essential part of the planning process. Here, Diane Gottsman, national etiquette expert and owner of The Protocol School of Texas, shares her tips on how to stick to a small guest list, even when it seems totally out of the question. END
BEGIN HERE   Once invitations are out, word may trickle in that a family member's upset they didn't find an invite in the mail. Be ready to deal with those who feel snubbed. "Pick up the phone and say, 'I hear through uncle so-and-so that you're unhappy because you didn't get invited, but I just wanted you to know it was a really tough decision, and we just needed to keep our numbers low. Please don't take it personally,'" Gottsman suggests. If a distant aunt who wasn't invited still sends a gift, send a gracious thank-you note but don't feel pressured to add her to your perfectly edited guest list. END
BEGIN HERE You think you know your fiancé's friends...and then the unthinkable happens. One of them hits on you! This can be a very sticky situation depending on the severity of the "pass," and needs to be handled with kid gloves. Here, real brides share how they handled a friend of their fiancé's hitting on them. Read on for some cringe-worthy situations! END
BEGIN HERE "My fiancé's college roommate, whom I'd never met, came for a visit around four months before the wedding. Ironically he was with his fiancé. I was in the kitchen putting finishing touches to dinner and this joker came in and grabbed my butt while asking if there was anything he could help me with! I was nauseated but said nothing till my fiancé Dan and I were alone. Thankfully Dan immediately disinvited his friend to our wedding." —Sara END
BEGIN HERE "Five years later I still get nightmares. At the rehearsal dinner my fiancé's best friend who I'd known for years got rip roaring drunk — understandable since his longtime girlfriend had just broken up with him. He grabs me in a corner and plants one on my lips. I slapped him and ran back to the party. The next day at the wedding he didn't even remember it happened. So I never said anything — this is my fiancé's BEST friend — but still cringe a little when he's around." —Diane END
BEGIN HERE "I told my fiancé the second his scuzzy friend — actually, second cousin — came on to me. My fiancé actually went and punched him out! I felt very taken care of and more in love than ever." —Tami END
BEGIN HERE "My fiancé's friend made sexually suggestive remarks to me at a barbecue. I called him on it, saying, 'Do you want to tell Eddie (my fiancé) or should I?' He turned beet red and said, 'I'm so sorry. It will never happen again.' And it hasn't!" —Kim END
BEGIN HERE "My fiancé invited an old friend of his over whom I'd never met. So this old friend turned out to be an ex of mine. I was so shocked I didn't say anything when we were 'introduced' and neither did he. The next day, he texted me to ask me out for a drink. That's when I fessed up to my fiancé. I didn't want to start our marriage off with lies or pretense." —Beth END

I said, 'That is a lovely compliment, and no I haven't been with a woman.' I also told her — which is true — that I'm happy in my relationship, but if I was gay she would definitely be on my radar!'" —Cara END
BEGIN HERE "When my fiancé's friend asked me if I wanted to meet him sometime for a drink in a not-so-platonic way, I said, 'I am going to pretend you never said that and you do the same thing or I will tell my fiancé and you will be toast.' He slunk away and has never bothered me again." —Nina END

UnReal costars Johanna Braddy and Freddie Stroma took their onscreen romance to the real world when Stroma recently popped the question to his beautiful bride-to-be. Days after making their new engagement status public, the too-cute twosome debuted Braddy's bold engagement ring on the red carpet, and guys, it is so unique. END
BEGIN HERE The real life lovebirds met while playing opposite one another on the hit Lifetime show, UnReal. Part drama, part parody of our guiltiest TV pleasure, The Bachelor, UnReal showed the behind-the-scenes on-goings of a fictional dating show, starring Stroma as the star suitor and Braddy as a contestant on the show. Guess all those steamy scenes took their affect because the pair sparked a relationship off camera, as well. And earlier this week, the couple officially announced that they were engaged and the bride-to-be has quite the ring to show for it! END
BEGIN HERE Making their first public appearance since the happy news hit the 'net, Braddy and Stroma were all smiles as they strutted along a New York City red carpet for the 2016 ABC Upfront Tuesday night. Rocking a white eyelet dress, we're already getting bridal vibes from Braddy that almost distracted from the huge rock on her finger. Keyword: Almost.

And if that wasn't enough sparkle for you, the sapphire is surrounded by a big, bold and beautiful diamond halo. UnReal, indeed... END

BEGIN HERE After JoJo Fletcher was blindsided last season on The Bachelor when Ben Higgins chose Lauren Bushnell over her to be his future wife, the TV star was devastated (and rightfully so, TBH). But now, taking the reigns herself, JoJo is back and ready for a new chance at love on Season 12 of The Bachelorette. Pictures of all 26 men who will be competing on the show for the bombshell's hand in marriage were released to the public last week — and by-golly are there some interesting guys vying for the bachelorette's love, one of them even being Aaron Rodger's brother, Jordan Rodgers, who is a former football player himself. END
BEGIN HERE Now, before you read on fellow Bachelor/Bachelorette fans, this is where we reveal a LOT of spoilers for the upcoming season, which hasn't even aired yet. The show's premiere date is set for this Monday, May 23, but after seeing pictures of a vaguely familiar Bachelorette frontrunner spotted holding hands with JoJo, we have a feeling we already know who the reality star decides to choose in the end. END
BEGIN HERE According to Reality Steve, who said "that this season is the JoJo and Jordan show," the ex-football player is one of the eight bachelors who make it to Buenos Aires in episode 6. And as reported by the HollywoodTake, he's also said to be part of the final four with bachelors Chase McNary, Luke Pell, and Robby Hayes. END
BEGIN HERE Others are saying that Jordan's appearance on the show is strictly business, made to garner more media exposure. Reality Steve even went so far as to say that Jordan is simply aiming to become the next Bachelor, but that being engaged to JoJo may be more beneficial (at a marketing standpoint) in the end. END
BEGIN HERE For JoJo's sake, we really hope the latter isn't true. And although we may know who the Bachelorette chooses in the end, we will have to wait and see if this love is one that's meant to last — or simply crash and burn insert cry emoji. END

BEGIN HERE  Alessandra Ambrosio always looks otherworldly: the perks of being a supermodel we suppose. She certainly turned a few heads at Cannes in a custom sky-blue crystal-embroidered silk-crepe gown from Michael Kors Collection. The length of her look was formal, but its plunging neckline, ring-accented cutouts, and thigh-high slits were high-octane sexiness—a bachelorette party number at its finest in a shorter length and perhaps just one leg-baring accent. You won't need much to start a conversation in a dress of this caliber, thus Alessandra kept her hair pin-straight and her skin bronzed and flawless. END

BEGIN HERE It's so exciting when a friend gets married, but sometimes the calendar just doesn't work out. What's a friend to do when they know they can't make it to such a milestone event? Our experts weigh in. END
BEGIN HERE When you know that you won't be able to attend a friend's wedding, let them know as soon as possible. Begin by giving them a call as soon as you're aware of the conflict and letting them know you won't be able to make it. That's right, pick up the phone — now isn't the time for a text or an email, unless you're in a different country and getting on the phone is a real challenge. If you find out before the invitations have been mailed, you could save them the postage (and the cost of printing that additional invite!). END
BEGIN HERE If you've gotten your invitation in the mail or they opted to send you one anyway, include a personal note in with your RSVP card. While traditional etiquette states that you're not required to send a gift if you can't attend, if the two of you are close, you might want to send something to honor the occasion, anyway. (This applies whether or not you got an invitation in the mail. If she's one of your best friends, you're probably as excited about her wedding as she is and should celebrate accordingly!) END
BEGIN HERE While you don't have to go into details about why you can't make it, you should give a little bit of an explanation. Let her know that you've got a huge work trip that weekend, or that your family's biannual reunion happens to fall on that same weekend in July, otherwise you'd be there in a heartbeat! END
BEGIN HERE And what if you've already RSVP'd yes and booked your flight, then find out you can't attend at the last minute? The most important thing you can do is call. Whether or not you're attending will affect the seating chart and meal orders, so give your friend as much advanced notice as possible. You also don't want her looking for you at the reception and worried or upset when she can't find you! END
BEGIN HERE 34 Mistakes All Wedding Guests Make END
BEGIN HERE Getting married on a cruise can be as easy as making a phone call to the cruise line, and speaking with one of their on-board event managers who can help you put everything together. It's sort of like dealing with an all-inclusive resort in that regard. END
BEGIN HERE But before you start cruising the Internet looking for the ship of your dreams, make sure the cruise line you've chosen actually offers at-sea weddings, if that's something important to you. Only a few companies encourage getting married by the captain on open water, most prefer to help you get married in a port of your choice. END
BEGIN HERE Why? Cruise lines are all registered in different countries, and the country and the port of call, and the legalities surrounding the marriage license paperwork are what complicate matters. Some cruise lines have you take care of all the paperwork in your departure port (sometimes right there at the cruise ship terminal) before you start your trip, and then do the ceremonial wedding on the high seas. END
BEGIN HERE A few only offer wedding ceremonies on board, officiated by the captain, before the ship embarks. That kicks off a heck of a honeymoon cruise with all your friends and loved ones tagging along. If the departure port is within a reasonable distance of your hometown, you may be able to include some guests who won't be able to join you on the honeymoon, but would like to be a part of the ceremony. END
BEGIN HERE Celebrity, Princess, and Cunard are among the most popular for saying "I do" at sea with the captain as your officiant. If getting married while the ship is underway is not an option, consider the cruise lines that offer wedding ceremonies on their private islands during a day-long stop. Disney offers both options, and gives you a Disney wedding experience without the cost and obligation of getting married in the Orlando or Anaheim resorts. END
BEGIN HERE Many cruise lines offer specific wedding packages for you and your guests, although the pricing may fluctuate based on the time of year. You'll be able to choose your décor, cake, and flowers from options A, B, or C. END
BEGIN HERE  What Destination Weddings Cost Guests in Travel and Accommodations END
BEGIN HERE Boutique luxury cruise line Seabourn has a reputation for planning extraordinary, personalized cruise ship weddings, for those who don't want a "cookie cutter" package. But they're also one of the most expensive. END
BEGIN HERE If you have a travel agent you've worked with before, this might be the time to bring in an outside professional to help get everything organized for your trip. An experienced travel professional will know which cruise lines offer what, and will know how to get you and your guests the most benefits and perks in the package. But if you don't want to deal with all that personally, the cruise lines are happy to play travel coordinator for your guests, and almost all of them offer travel deals to/from the port where the ship departs.

The best part? You can totally get in on her healthy habits, too. Here are eight things Hough swears by when it comes to living well: END
BEGIN HERE Hough's secret to feeling balanced? Focus on how your habits affect you on the inside. "For me, it's how I feel rather than how I look. Because when I'm focused on how I I look, it's never good enough, and then I just keep working too hard. I push myself too much or I deprive myself too much, and then I just binge eat or I fall off the wagon. So I think that if I'm feeling good, then I'm looking good." END
BEGIN HERE About a year after graduating college together in December of 2013, Emily White and Erik Gromacki moved to Dallas, Texas. The couple loved exploring their new city together, and that's exactly what Emily thought they were doing when Erik planned a picnic at the Dallas Arboretum's Poetry Garden. END
BEGIN HERE Emily had no idea that her best friend Maddie was at the Poetry Garden, ready to capture the moment that would change her life forever. Soon after their engagement, the couple started planning their May 24, 2015, wedding, and invited 100 guests to watch them become husband and wife at the Aristide Event Center in Mansfield, Texas. They wanted their day to be intimate and personal, but since nearly everyone was traveling for the big day, it was important to Emily and Erik that the party still felt like a destination wedding. Read on to see how their vision came together, as photographed by Ben Q. Photography. END

BEGIN HERE The couple chose the Aristide Event Center as their venue because of its rustic and romantic feel. "I saw it in a magazine and just knew I had to get married there," the bride says. "It reminded me of a photo out of a storybook." Although the bride originally hails from Ohio, she now calls Dallas home — but even with her close proximity to the locale, Emily admits she struggled with not being entirely familiar with the area. Luckily, her professional prowess (she works as a wedding and event producer at Bella Flora!) and industry friends made pulling of the wedding a breeze. END
BEGIN HERE Emily admits she found it sometimes difficult to juggle her own wedding prep with her work schedule, but she still managed to design and plan the big day herself, while Erik was left in charge of the travel plans to St. Lucia for their honeymoon. END

BEGIN HERE This week, the versatility of the red lip is on full display with three wedding beauty looks from the Cannes Film Festival. END
BEGIN HERE The final red lip look takes things to a grungier level and is perfect for the bride who likes her glamour with a side of rocker chic. For the complexion, use a lightweight cushion compact foundation or BB Cream, so your natural skintone shows through. Fill in your brows with a shade much darker than your natural hair color, but brush through them to keep things looking natural. Next, tightline around both eyes and then use a gray kohl liner all around the eyes, smudging thoroughly. Create a tiny flick out the outer corners to give the slight impression of a cateye, and apply mascara. For the lips, apply a berry stain, or, for another method, you can apply a traditional mascara and then blot your lips on a tissue until all the cream is until all that is left is the stained effect. END

BEGIN HERE A number of thoughts come to mind when you make a wish on a fallen eyelash, but if you're reading this you're likely wishing those darn lashes wouldn't fall out in the first place. When it comes to your eye lashes, there's no such thing as too much. And as you consider the ways in which you can amp up your eye makeup look for the big day, you're probably thinking about your options. DIY falsies are tricky, waterproof mascara is fine, but for truly melt-proof, smudge-proof, don't-even-need-liner lashes, eyelash extensions are worth serious consideration. END
BEGIN HERE Extensions usually last up to two or three weeks, they'll stay put throughout the entire weekend of wedding festivities and they're perfect for a beach honeymoon where you'll spend most of the time without makeup. "The best part is that the textures are so natural, that you simply look like yourself, but better," says Soul Lee, founder of Beautiful Soul Makeup Studio.

(If the question hasn't already been popped, that is!) "Gwen saved my life last year," Shelton recently told CMT's Hot 20 Countdown.

BEGIN HERE Hey, we're allowed to dream, aren't we? END
BEGIN HERE Doesn't a love as colorful as yours deserve a wedding day to match? Come summertime, we get a little obsessed with sunny hues, pops of unexpected color, and bright blooms. Sure, you can serve a pretty-in-hot-pink wedding cake anytime of the year, but when the sun is shining just as brightly as the hue, it somehow makes it all taste just a little bit sweeter. That's why we've officially fallen head over heels in love with this pretty and punchy wedding color palette — inspired by the exotic Bahia, Brazil! — for summer nuptials and destination "I dos." What are you waiting for, summertime brides? How could you say no to a color palette as red hot as your romance? END
BEGIN HERE The stunning Brazilian state of Bahia is the door to jewel-toned cities, cobblestone streets, old-world buildings, heart-pumping festivals, and paradise beaches — perfect for a destination wedding, or just for endless inspiration for tropical-themed hometown celebration We're stealing the romantic region's tropical hues for a wedding theme that's too swoon-worthy to resist. END
BEGIN HERE Summery wedding invitations in bright shades of orange and pink should be the first thing on your to-do list. Your guests will be dreaming of ocean breezes and fabulous fiestas before they even send in their RSVPs. END
BEGIN HERE An easy breezy white dress, adorned with an bold and beautiful pattern is a must for your 'maids to both keep them cool under the summer sun as well as incorporate your Bahia theme into their wedding day wear. When it's your turn to walk down the aisle, grasp a bold bouquet of tropical-hued blooms that'll look as bright and happy as you feel. END
BEGIN HERE As the sun begins to set, dine on boldly patterned and crazy colorful dinnerware and then slice into a wedding cake decorated with even more brilliant blooms for another tropical pop of bold color. Now this is what we call, as they say in Brazil, a festa! END
BEGIN HERE You don't want to be a pushy bride. But on these three etiquette issues, our expert says, you shouldn't feel bad to put your crystal peep-toe pump down for a better wedding day. END
BEGIN HERE   Think about it: While it's fun for your partner to take you out for a surprise night on the town, you still need to know whether you should slip on your dancing shoes or come prepared with an extra pair of socks for bowling. END
BEGIN HERE The same applies to a wedding, says Keel. "It may seem pushy to mention a dress code on your invitations, but guests most often appreciate being told what they should expect to wear," she says. "No one likes to be in the dark on whether they're going to be over or under dressed. Stating the dress code puts them at ease and helps them to plan accordingly. And for any guest that does find this pushy, consider it insurance to yourself that they're now on the hook to find something else other than that way-too-casual outfit they had planned." END
BEGIN HERE Whether you've created a registry, set up a honeymoon fund, or are asking for charitable donations in lieu of gifts, having a wedding means that people will want to get you gifts to celebrate the big event. Brand new dishes, enough cash to cover those massages, or a hefty check to send to your favorite organization? It's a win-win, right? And if you have friends who are creative or crafty, they might be inclined to put their skills to use and create something that's truly one-of-a-kind in honor of your marriage. But what if the handmade gift in question is more amateur craft than work of art? Here's how our experts think you should respond. END
BEGIN HERE Not every friend is a wiz with a paintbrush or a sculpting pro, which means some of those handmade items aren't the quality you'd want to display on your bookshelf or coffee table. But the first thing to remember is that someone who loves you put in the time and effort to create this object for you. Begin by sending a thank you note acknowledging how much you appreciate the work they did to make something for you, and thanking them for their friendship. Don't lie about how much you love it, but instead focus on what the gift means and how much you value them as a person. END
BEGIN HERE Of course, there's the age-old question of what to do with a gift you, well, hate when the giver comes over to visit. Find a special spot to display the item, no matter how awful you might think it is. If you have the space, keep the knick knack on your bedside table or hang the artwork in your office, somewhere it won't be front-and-center in your home but that also shows the personal connection you have to the piece. If it's really just something you can't display, keep it amongst similar objects you love to create a vignette of sorts that will help to camouflage the item, and hope that future moments of celebration have a different outcome. END
BEGIN HERE  How Much Time It Really Takes to DIY Wedding Favors END
BEGIN HERE Since getting engaged and setting a date, you've probably been closely critiquing professional wedding photographers to find one who will capture your most beautiful wedding-day moments. But have you given any thought to doing some boudoir photography as a fun way to celebrate this special time in your life? We caught up with Jenny Taylor of Jenny Taylor Boudoir Photography to get a better idea of what brides-to-be can expect. END
BEGIN HERE It's usually best to schedule a boudoir photoshoot about two to three months before your wedding, according to Taylor. Chances are, you're getting yourself physically and emotionally prepared for tying the knot so you will look and feel your best, Taylor says. "Plus, the excitement and happiness a bride-to-be is feeling before her wedding really shows through in photos." END
BEGIN HERE On the topic of looking camera-ready, schedule any waxing appointments five to seven days before your photoshoot to avoid having any lingering bumps or redness. And don't succumb to the lure of the spray tan — it's too risky. If you do use any self-tanning products, stop applying them at least 5 days before your shoot. END
BEGIN HERE "One of the biggest misconceptions about boudoir photography is that wearing super-sexy, skimpy lingerie is a requirement," Taylor notes. "While a lot of clients do choose teddies, chemises, or négligées, some opt for something playful like a jersey from their guy's favorite sports team." Another option is to go for a more in-the-moment look that's highly suggestive but less revealing, like a silky robe or strategically placed bedsheet. END
BEGIN HERE Taylor says the key is to pick something that highlights whatever body part you're most proud of and to choose a few different outfit options ahead of time. Try on everything before going to the shoot so you know that your selections fit well and you're comfortable showing off your body type. For instance, if you really love your stomach, then a few different bra and panty sets — some classic, some modern — are a good idea. If you have an hourglass body type, then show off your curves with a bustier or form-fitting lingerie. END
BEGIN HERE As far as accessories and props go, less is more, according to Taylor. A simple pair of high heels to match your attire, and minimal jewelry — think stud earrings and a single-strand necklace — plus your engagement ring. END
BEGIN HERE  7 Sexy Props You Didn't Think to Use For Your Boudoir Shoot END
BEGIN HERE You're probably not used to taking photos in lingerie or sexy attire, so how do you begin to pump yourself up? Taylor tells brides to "channel their inner Victoria's Secret supermodel" to get into the right head space for this type of activity. That means staying away from any foods that will make you bloat and chugging plenty of water for a few days beforehand. And don't have a cocktail or two in an effort to squelch any nerves. "The photoshoot itself and the final product are always better when the client is clear headed and focused," Taylor says. END
BEGIN HERE Picking the perfect honeymoon location is no easy feat — countless destinations, endless hotel options, and finding the ideal spot to suit both you and your new spouse's needs... how do you choose? Well, we've got you covered. Whether you're looking for inexpensive honeymoon ideas, ultra-romantic getaway locales, the trip of a lifetime or a combination of all three, you've come to the right spot.

BEGIN HERE Whether you want your bridesmaids to all look alike as they stand next to you at the altar or you'd rather encourage each to have her own personal flair, the shoe choice is crucial in completing a wedding-day look. Once the dresses are chosen and accessories decided, it's time to focus on what fabulous shoes your girls should don to walk with you down the aisle. Thankfully there are plenty of chic stores for Chicago brides and their closest friends to find the perfect fit when seeking out the best shoes for the bridal party. END
BEGIN HERE Congratulations are in order for Eva Longoria! The former Desperate Housewives actress is officially a married woman, having wed her media mogul fiancé, José Antonio Bastón in a private wedding in Mexico just hours ago. END
BEGIN HERE The adorable twosome said "I do" in front of 200 guests in a sunset wedding ceremony at a private residence in Valle de Bravo, Mexico — a lakeside town just roughly 88 miles from Mexico City, a source confirmed to People. "They married on an altar under lots of little lights," the source said. "It was very romantic. Eva wore her hair down and smiled during the whole ceremony. He was in a gray suit." END
BEGIN HERE While the actress didn't post any wedding photos to Instagram herself — we would imagine she's quite busy being the bride and all! — we did happen to find a few snaps of the super private nuptials on the social media site. Al Rojo Vivo, a Telemundo news program, posted a few pics of the blessed event (see below) and we could not be more thrilled to get a glimpse of this gorgeous wedding. The photos show Longoria, clad in a sleeveless fit-and-flare white wedding dress made complete by a delicate sweetheart neckline, and Baston exchanging their vows in front of a giant white cross overlooking the lake. END
BEGIN HERE Prior to the couple's clandestine wedding, People reported that "half of hollywood" was expected to fly in for Longoria and Bastón's "I do's," with the star-studded guest list including David and Victoria Beckham, Penelope Cruz, Ricky Martin, Katy Perry, Mario Lopez. Swanky, much? END
BEGIN HERE The ceremony was said to be taking place at Jane The Virgin actor Jaime Camil's home in Acapulco, with the bride-to-be all but confirming the locale herself with some telling Instagrams of her Mexican getaway (below), posting one scenic photo with the location tag of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and the next with the tag of Acapulco. Both equally jealousy-inducing. The bride-to-be also shared a cute pic of her doing a little pre-wedding yoga in a very impressive pose Saturday morning (below). END
BEGIN HERE Longoria hasn't been private about her affection for her now husband. "He's amazing, he's gorgeous, and really the kindest human being I've ever met," the Telenovela actress told People. Back in December, Bastón popped the question to Longoria in a dazzling desert proposal in the sand dunes of Dubai with a GORGEOUS ruby red engagement ring. "He did the whole thing. He had been planning for, like, six months!" the bride-to-be told Entertainment Tonight of the memorable night. "I cried with laughter," she shared. "I was laughing so hard and then it turned into a cry... It was a lot of fun." END
BEGIN HERE Back in February, Longoria revealed to Us Weekly that she and her soon-to-be hubby have "been calling each other husband and wife for a while." Well, looks like those titles are official! END
BEGIN HERE See the sneak peek photos of their hush-hush wedding below. END
BEGIN HERE In the throes of wedding planning, it's easy to forget that you and your soon-to-be spouse aren't the only ones super stressed. "Wedding planning and the wedding day itself are stressful for not only the couple, but also the mother-of-the-bride," says Jaclyn Fisher, owner of Two Little Birds Planning in Philadelphia. END
BEGIN HERE Why? As John Duffy, Ph.D., licensed clinical psychologist and author of The Available Parent, explains, "just like the bride, her mother has an awful lot to accomplish, and a lot of planning to do, leading up to the wedding day. Along with that, it is important to keep in mind that she has also been envisioning this day for many, many years. It is an important day for her too." END
BEGIN HERE So in between easing your own anxiety, be sure to take care of your mom, too. Here, our experts suggest five ways you can soothe even the most stressed mother of the bride. END
BEGIN HERE   Says Duffy, "This may seem like an odd or elementary piece of advice, but in my experience, there is nothing that makes a mother of the bride happier and less stressed than to see her daughter, and her future son-in-law, happy. So, come to her to help solve pre-wedding problems and issues, sure — but also go to her when you feel blissful. She is going to want to be a part of that as well." END
BEGIN HERE Deciding to keep or change your last name when you get married is a deeply personal one. Whether you're making the decision based on tradition, your profession, your personal beliefs, or the fact that changing your name can be a huge hassle, what you decide to do is totally up to you! But that doesn't change the fact that people often assume that women will change their names when they get married. So if you're in the minority and decide that you like your maiden name, #thankyouverymuch, how can you let people know? Our experts have some advice. END
BEGIN HERE Spreading the word about keeping your last name starts way before you say "I do." Expecting a few monogrammed items from friends or relatives as gifts? Add a note on your wedding website alongside the link to your registry specifying both of your individual monograms — and adding that you'll be staying Mrs. Jones instead of becoming Mrs. Smith. Encourage your mom, future mother-in-law, and bridesmaids to spread the word, as well. They don't have to offer an explanation, but if anyone asks, they'll be prepared to say "Nope, she's not changing her name!" END
BEGIN HERE On your wedding day, be sure to have your officiant announce you as as Mr. Jason Smith and Mrs. Elizabeth Jones, and ask your band leader or DJ to introduce you the same way when you make your grand entrance into the reception. Those post-wedding thank you notes? Put both of your full names above the address, or use both last names (like "The Jones/Smith Family" or simply "Jones/Smith") — you may want to avoid a hyphen, which implies that you've combined your last names into a single name. END
BEGIN HERE There's a good chance a few people will mess up, which is the time to politely let them know. Don't get mad, but say something like "Thank you so much for the monogrammed towels! I did want to let you know, however, that I won't be taking Jason's last name. But we will definitely still be using such a generous gift!" END

BEGIN HERE You chose the dress. You waited for the dress. Finally, it's time for your first fitting. And whether you've picked a structured gown or a flowing slip dress, you'll want to make sure that it fits absolutely perfectly. We've enlisted the help of Rita Ertl, Monique Lhuillier's Director of Alterations and pinner of thousands of dresses, to find out the questions every bride should ask at her fitting. END
BEGIN HERE   In her 30+ years as a fitter, Ertl has encountered one question more than any other: "What if I lose weight?" And, while dealing with 100 last minute to-dos, many brides do lose weight — a lot of weight — before the big day. Ertl says planning is key, "I schedule each fitting to accommodate a final fitting close to the wedding to make sure the gown is perfect!!" Request that your final fitting be no earlier than 10 days before your wedding. Ertl believes that will still give the seamstresses enough time to make final adjustments and give you enough time to pick up your dress well in advance of your wedding. END

BEGIN HERE While you'll probably want to wear your engagement ring all the time, there are definitely moments when you should take it off, like while you're cleaning or doing dishes or heading to the gym to lift weights. And while it's totally safe tucked back into the ring box, you'll want to have a few other safe places to stash your newest accessory so that it doesn't accidentally slip into the sink or fall behind your dresser. Thankfully, ring dishes are more than just functional: They're totally cute, and make fantastic engagement gifts! We've rounded up some of our favorites to fit every style, from sweet to funky to a little bit cheeky. Take a peek! END

BEGIN HERE Say it ain't so! Alison Brie might be one of the top engaged celebs we've been positively dying to see in a wedding dress, but as it turns out, we might not every get to see this beautiful bride-to-be rock a white gown. Dave Franco recently revealed some major wedding news about his upcoming nuptials to the How to Be Single star, and it totally just knocked us off our feet. END
BEGIN HERE Franco and Brie happen to be one particularly silent couple when it comes to wedding plans and their romantic relationship. After dating for three years, Franco popped the question to the former Mad Men actress in August of 2015 and slipped a sizable rose gold sparkler on her finger. Since then, the two have been tightlipped over their wedding plans. Brie is a self-proclaimed "not very bridal" sort-of gal and never really saw herself tying the knot until she met her hubby-to-be. "Marriage never really interested me," she previously divulged to Yahoo Style. "I guess because I was very focused on my work. I wasn't sure if I really saw the point to it." But now that Brie's a bonafide bride-to-be, we've been anxiously awaiting her walk down the aisle — which may not look exactly the way we imagined. END
BEGIN HERE At the premiere of his new comedy Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising, Franco shared some wedding news with E! Online. "We keep kinda paring it down," Franco shared, "to the point we might elope." Excuse us, but what?! "It just seems easy, and simple, and nice," the actor explained. "I don't need a big wedding. I don't want a big wedding." END
BEGIN HERE Okay, that we totally get... Wedding planning is unquestionably stressful, after all. And there's nothing at all wrong with eloping. (We love a short little white dress for city hall nuptials!) But, call us selfish — we were really looking forward to seeing the beautiful Brie all decked out in lace and tulle. END
BEGIN HERE But, hey, we're sure she'd look just as stunning in a little white frock! And we KNOW Franco would look like a total babe in just about any groom outfit... END

You may still be a mixed bag of emotions this week, but expect the mood to lighten considerably, says astrologer Suzie Kerr Wright. For more deets and to find out exactly what the stars have in store for you, peep her horoscopes below. END
BEGIN HERE   All things related to travel and higher education become priority during this time. If either of these things had been put on hold a while back, it's time to revisit them. Cooperation from your loved ones, particularly your fiancé, will make it much easier to find the time and resources for your dream. END

BEGIN HERE Quite possibly the most confusing couple of the 21st century, Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth, or Miliam as we like to call them, has yet to confirm that their engagement is indeed "back on" after Cyrus has been repeatedly spotted wearing the engagement ring Hemsworth gifted her their first time around. We've been practically pulling our hair out dying to know whether a wedding is in the works or not, and finally we got some insight into what the h-e-double-hockey-sticks is going on with The Last Song duo thanks to Cyrus' lovable dad, Billy Ray Cyrus. END
BEGIN HERE When asked by E! News if his daughter is "offish" engaged, Billy Ray, 54, didn't exactly give us a black and white answer, but did say the cutest darn thing about his baby girl and her (hopefully) hubby-to-be. END
BEGIN HERE "Here's what I do know. They're so happy. That's the main thing," Billy Ray told Carissa Culiner of E! News. "Miley and I, we always had this slogan — 'If you ain't happy, it ain't working.' Just seeing these — I still call 'em kids — these two kids happy, that's all that matters.'" END
BEGIN HERE Unfortunately for us, the couple, who has been seen this past year hanging out with Hemsworth's family in Australia (while Cyrus dons a ring on THAT finger), has kept their possible re-engagement under wraps, choosing not to comment on the rumors. But if they ever do decide to tie the knot, Billy Ray said he will be there for them every step of the way. END
BEGIN HERE "If any of my kids decide that they're gonna have a wedding of any kind, whatever role they want me to play, I'll be there, you know what I mean? They want me to be the butler — that's fine. Whatever they choose. I might make a good preacher." END
BEGIN HERE If only all of us were so lucky to have such a supportive and encouraging dad! This is one wedding we would do pretty much anything to see, especially if this doting dad served as their officiant. Until that day arrives, we'll sit here and dream of their picture-perfect, and more than likely wild, nuptials. END
BEGIN HERE  Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth Have Reportedly Chosen a Wedding Destination! END
BEGIN HERE You may think you've talked your wedding to death by the time the week-of rolls around. But you're not done yet. As Jaclyn Fisher, owner of Two Little Birds Planning, so aptly explains, "communication is important throughout the entire planning process, and especially the week of the wedding." And here, our experts say, are six talks you must have during those seven days. END
BEGIN HERE   Lastly, says Fisher, you should get real about how both of you are feeling as your wedding day approaches. "The week of the wedding, couples should have a general check in to talk about how they're each feeling, what's on their minds, and what, if anything, is causing them stress," she says. "Hearing how excited your fiancé is feeling may ease your nerves. There may be a problem that you're unaware of, but able to help solve. And sometimes it just feels good to vent and get it all out. Communication is key in all relationships, but extra important the week of the wedding." END
BEGIN HERE From the back, you'd never know from that she is pregnant; from the front, however — former Hills star Audrina Patridge is all bump...and it's pretty adorable. The expecting mama showed off her basketball belly and a peek of her engagement ring bling in several adorable Instagram snaps. END
BEGIN HERE In the below photos, 31-year-old Patridge posed for a profile shot in an American Apparel dressing room while trying on several fitted cotton dresses in various colors, US Magazine reports. The Hills alum was trying the dresses on to find the perfect outfit for her friend's baby shower, asking her followers via Instagram, "Black.... Red.....or nude?... #americanapparell?" Later, she shared a photo of herself and her friend at the baby shower — which clearly shows that she picked the nude dress (and the pregnancy weight-gain gods are in her favor). Talk about chic maternity style! END
BEGIN HERE The reality star announced that she and her fiancé, Corey Bohan, were expecting their first child together (a baby girl) in December. Since then the bump (or should we say post-Mexican food burrito bump?) has made an appearance in a plethora photos on her social media channels. Beach, bikinis, selfies, and now dressing rooms — you name it — the bump has been there. END
BEGIN HERE 2015 was quite a year for Patridge; in December she announced her pregnancy, sharing a pregnancy test wrapped in a festive gift box, saying, "I finally figured out what to get Corey for Christmas," hashtagging the adorable pic with "BabyOnTheWay!" This exciting news came shortly after her hubby-to-be popped the question at a restaurant during the Thanksgiving holiday. END
BEGIN HERE  10 Signs He's About to Propose END
BEGIN HERE Patridge recalled her proposal story to People as a sweet romantic dinner with her BMX-rider beau, saying, "When dessert time came he ordered cheesecake and the waiter brought it out on a platter with a beautiful silver cover. I noticed all the waitresses gathering with phones and thought, 'What is going on?!' Then, all of a sudden, the waiter lifted the silver cover and I saw the ring in a box with white rose petals on the plate." END
BEGIN HERE The crowd stood by and watched, as the love of her life asked her the question that would forever change their lives. "Then Corey dropped to his knee and said, 'We have been together for many years now and I love you more than anything. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Will you marry me?'" Patridge recalled. "I was in shock and kind of didn't even hear him but I said yes!" So sweet. END
BEGIN HERE Mama-to-be and bride-to-be, it's going to be a very exciting year for soon-to-be Mrs. Bohan. See the adorable pics, below, of her growing belly. We can't wait to meet baby Bohan; you know she'll be a very well-documented little lady! END
BEGIN HERE When your romance spans three continents, a destination wedding is pretty much a given. Priscilla Angriawan and Andree Wijaya grew up in Indonesia, dated long-distance when she was in college in Boston, and settled down together in Jakarta. So when they got engaged — while on vacation in Budapest, no less — they knew they'd travel for their wedding too. "We looked all over the world," Priscilla says. "Africa, Napa, France, but we chose Bali since it's a place we know and love." They chose the Alila Villas Uluwatu as the site of their October 18, 2014, nuptials and invited 330 guests to join them for an unforgettable cliffside ceremony and secret garden-inspired reception in paradise — all with a touch of rustic appeal. END
BEGIN HERE Priscilla and Andree enlisted the help of the team at Multi Kreasi Enterprise to bring their spectacular celebration to life — and to handle the tricky logistics. "Our venue had never done a wedding with more than 250 people before so there wasn't enough space to fit everyone for the reception," the bride says. But their florist and decorator, Floralines, was able to build a platform overtop the outdoor pool that would accommodate the entire group. The end result was nothing short of breathtaking, and lucky for us, Elizabeth Messina captured every moment of this spectacular wedding. Read on to see the epic photos of Priscilla and Andree's day. END
BEGIN HERE It was a long day for the bride and groom, who kicked off their celebration with a traditional Chinese wedding ceremony. "We made sure to include all of the customs my grandmother really wanted," says the bride. Priscilla donned a red silk gown and an ornate headpiece, which was an exact replica of the one her mother wore at her own wedding 20 years before. END
BEGIN HERE With the help of her 'maids, who later changed out of their floral silk robes into pale peach-hued gowns, Priscilla changed into a custom-made Adrian Gan French-lace wedding dress for the next ceremony. "I wanted to wear another dress that matched my personality," Priscilla says. "I loved the lace that was spread out around the train, dress, and my veil. Their placement gave it a simple feel but still looked really unique." END
BEGIN HERE Her veil was custom-made by the designer, too. She finished off her look with Manolo Blahnik heels, a necklace gifted from her in-laws, and hair accessories designed by Rinaldy Yunardi specifically for Priscilla. END
BEGIN HERE She had initially wanted a long-sleeved wedding dress, but the Bali heat meant she would be far too warm. The solution? Her dress designer created lace "sleeves" that she slipped on for the ceremony, giving Priscilla the traditional look she loved but still offering comfort. END
BEGIN HERE The bride's bouquet featured statement-making blooms, like blushing-bride and king proteas. "I wanted it to feel a little rustic but still very special," she says. END
BEGIN HERE Priscilla's four bridesmaids wore dresses created by Belle Marie. In addition to dried flower crowns, each important woman carried a bouquet of hydrangeas, roses, protea, and brunia berries. END
BEGIN HERE Although they didn't serve as her bridesmaids, Priscilla also wanted her future sister-in-laws to stand out, so asked each to wear a different mint green dress. END
BEGIN HERE The bride and groom shared a first look before the ceremony, and although they had already seen each other for the traditional ceremony that morning, it was still a poignant experience. "It felt different from the morning because I was in my dress now," Priscilla says. "It was real to me. I was quite touched and cried." Andree looked handsome in his navy blue suit from Zegna. He finished his look with a blushing bride protea boutonniere. END
BEGIN HERE The couple's youngest attendants might have been the most adorable flower girls and ring bearers we've seen yet. Priscilla and Andree's nieces looked too sweet in their floor-length dresses and flower crowns while their nephews donned tailor-made shirts and shorts. END
BEGIN HERE The ceremony was held at the edge of the clear platform built overtop the pool and overlooking the Indian Ocean. The biggest showstopper? A massive floral arch, packed with tons of gorgeous blooms in muted shades of pink and green. To keep guests comfortable during the outdoor I do's, each seat had a bag that was filled with a fan, program, water, handkerchief for happy tears, and bells to ring once the bride and groom shared their first kiss. END
BEGIN HERE "I wanted something to say our vows underneath that we could still look through," the bride says. "It was important to me that everyone could still see the ocean because that was the whole reason we wanted our wedding in Bali. We chose dryer-looking flowers for a rustic feel." END
BEGIN HERE The 5 p.m. ceremony included traditional Christian vows that were officiated by a pastor from the couple's church at home in Jakarta. END
BEGIN HERE Priscilla and Andree really wanted an outdoor reception, but October brings unpredictable weather to Bali and there was a strong chance there would be rain on the wedding day. For that reason, they were forced to cover the reception space, but the bride hated the look of the clear-top tent. "We decided to cover it with branches, lights, and chandeliers to create the illusion of being in a cozy, outdoor garden," says Priscilla. "It was a challenge to bring the garden inside, but we made it work." END
BEGIN HERE Their florist decorated long tables with loads of driftwood, succulents, and tropical flowers, adding rustic touches like wood rounds and antique birdcages to bring in the rustic look Priscilla and Andree both love. "I really didn't specify the types of flowers I wanted, just that I wanted a variety of different centerpieces. Our head table was my favorite," she says. END
BEGIN HERE Dinner was served his-and-hers style, so guests dined on either Andree's meaty dishes or Priscilla's pescetarian selections. The self-proclaimed foodie couple wanted to be sure their menu featured high-quality meal choices and options that were highly representative of what they enjoy. END
BEGIN HERE In lieu of a traditional guestbook, the couple asked friends and family to leave a "message in the bottle" for them to read after the wedding. END
BEGIN HERE After dinner, a jazz band the couple had flown in from Jakarta kept guests on the dance floor. "The ceremonies were the most important part of the day for us," says the bride, "but if we were throwing a party, we wanted to make sure it was unforgettable!" END

BEGIN HERE How you decide to schedule toasts throughout your wedding weekend is totally up to you. Some people opt for a set list of speakers, with some speaking at the rehearsal dinner and others (often the parents of the couple and the maid of honor and best man) speaking at the wedding reception, while others prefer an open mic at the welcome party and only toasts from the parents at the reception. No matter how you choose to break it down, the newlyweds should definitely plan to take the mic for a moment or two at the reception. But what should you say? Our experts have a few ideas. END
BEGIN HERE The most important thing to include in your toast is a few words of thanks — to the hosts, to both of your parents, and to your guests for joining you. If you don't love public speaking (or want to get back to the party!), you can keep it as brief and basic as that, finish by telling your new spouse how happy you are to be married, and then get back to the dance floor. END
BEGIN HERE If you want to extrapolate a little bit more, thank your spouse's parents and family for raising such an amazing person and for welcoming you into their family. Thank your wedding party for their friendship and support, and thank your spouse for their hard work through the wedding planning process. You've already said your vows, so you don't need to go into too much more detail about why you love him or her, but a brief acknowledgement would be totally appropriate. END
BEGIN HERE Tradition states that the groom usually makes the toast at the reception, but do whatever feels right, whether that means you speaking instead of him or both of you taking a moment to say something (and to say something to one another!). END

BEGIN HERE There's a reason Condé Nast Traveler named Australia its number one must-visit destination for 2016. It's a massive country encircled by beautiful playgrounds just waiting to be explored — especially by honeymooners! Sydney, the capital of New South Wales, is a perfect example. As one of the largest cities in the country it has plenty of major sights — the Opera House, Harbour Bridge, Royal Botanic Gardens — incredible food and sophisticated design, but it's also immersed in nature. The air is clean, it's lush and tropical. Because of its position on the east coast of Australia, it comprises miles and miles of breathtaking coastline, beaches and parks. END

BEGIN HERE For a Sydney-based honeymoon, you could go a few ways. If you're more of a cosmopolitan couple, a top luxury hotel near The Rocks or Circular Quay is the best plan. For the highest panoramic view of those iconic sights consider the Shangri-La, where you can watch the sun go down from the 36th floor at Blu Bar. Or try the Langham Sydney, which is conveniently located near Darling Harbour, where you'll want to charter a sailboat for a day out on the picturesque Sydney Harbour. END

Check out the charming neighborhood of Potts Point for romantic meals at Cho Cho San, Apollo, and creative, cheekily named cocktails at throwback New York-style bar The Roosevelt, and Surry Hills for boutique shopping on Crown Street and extraordinary eateries such as Bar H and Marque. Take the ferry to Manly for a peek at the famous Northern Suburbs, or to the excellent Taronga Zoo. A show at the Opera House is also advisable, as is a starlit glass — or bottle — of Champagne at the bar that runs under it. END

BEGIN HERE Ocean lovers seeking more of a typical honeymoon vibe and TLC can find it in the Eastern Suburbs, which include Coogee and Bronte. The new QT Bondi is just across the street from one of the most famous beaches in the world, Bondi, and with its bright, modern studio apartment-style suites makes a perfect crash pad for a coast-centric trip. Borrow their beach cruisers and check out the neighborhood, or run or walk the famous cliff-top path all the way to Coogee (where the beachy-chic Coogee Pavilion restaurant and bar is a must for brunch, drinks or even dinner and beyond), taking time to indulge in all the incredibly gorgeous photo ops.

Visit Clovelly for a game of bowls — the Australian version of bocce — played with spectacular views from the clifftop perch and a cold cider in hand. When you want to relive your wedding toast, do it with a bottle of bubbly at Iceberg's, the chichi perch above the much-photographed Bondi pool (perfect Instagram spot!). Fantastic boutiques (Tuchuzy, Camilla) and cafes and restaurants — North Bondi Fish, Drake, Bondi Hardware and Da Orazio Pizza + Porchetta — also surround the QT. END

BEGIN HERE Like L.A., there are beautiful, easy side trips to be taken from Sydney. A couple hours' drive or train ride inland gets you to the Blue Mountains, where you can hike to waterfalls and stroll hand-in-hand around quaint small towns. A few hours south is Jervis Bay, home to some of the most brilliant turquoise waters anywhere, which are rivaled only in beauty by the miles of beaches around hippie haven Byron Bay, a short flight north. Of course, the Great Barrier Reef (specifically Hayman Island), also a relatively brief flight away, is hard to top when it comes to spectacular seas and sands. The bottom line: If you're going to journey Down Under, you might as well see as much of it as you can (though you're well off saving Western Australia for another trip). END
BEGIN HERE The first trailer for the live-action retelling of Disney's Beauty and the Beast just dropped and it's got us humming the film's know-by-heart tunes all day. So we did what we do best: We planned a Beauty and the Beast-themed wedding, of course! Because we just can't wait until the movie's March 2017 premiere date (So. Far. Away.) to see Emma Watson fall in love and wed her prince-turned-beast, we threw together some ideas for a big day inspired by the iconic story. What are you waiting for? Come "Be Our Guest" at our Beauty and the Beast-inspired wedding! END
BEGIN HERE Excitement has been swirling over this live-action remake ever since Emma Watson first tweeted out the news that she had been cast as Belle. And could you really see anyone other than the basically-already-a-princess Watson in the lead role? Finally we caught a glimpse of the actress in the tale as old as time Monday morning when the first teaser trailer for the film premiered on Good Morning America. But it's just not enough! So we dreamt up all the darling details of a Beauty and the Beast inspired big day, natch. If Emma Watson is ever heading down the aisle herself, we've totally got her covered... END
BEGIN HERE Beauty and the Beast Wedding END
BEGIN HERE First thing's first, what's Belle's dream wedding venue? A library, of course! The brunette bookworm would without a doubt tie the knot amongst floor-to-ceiling shelves full of her beloved books, so a similar "I do" locale is a no brainer for a Disney themed wedding. The New York Public Library and the Boston Public Library are two favorite iconic venues amongst bibliophile brides. Dainty place settings featuring (hopefully spellbound) tea sets are another subtle nod to the film. And reference the magnificent rose Watson marvels at in the new trailer with a romantic red rose bouquet and centerpieces featuring the enchanting bloom. As for the reception noms, we're picturing a luxe, tiered wedding cake and of course you can't forget the grey stuff — it's delicious! END

BEGIN HERE Pretty sure Nev Schulman is having the most exciting month ever. The host of MTV's series Catfish, which follows the journey of couples who have formed online relationships without having met in person, is not only expecting his first child, but also getting married! Schulman announced his engagement to his pregnant girlfriend Laura Perlongo Sunday night with some seriously impressive engagement ring selfies (below) that show off her gorgeous diamond ring. END
BEGIN HERE Less than two weeks after the couple announced they were expecting their first child together, People reports, Schulman broke the news of their new engagement status on social media with photos highlighting Perlongo's new bridal bling, which appears to be round-cut diamond engulfed by a platinum swirl band. END
BEGIN HERE "We're enraged!!!" Schulman, 31, jokingly captioned the selfie. Then on Monday, he followed up the playful pic with a more sentimental Instagram, which shows the totally in love couple cuddling. "Seriously though, couldn't be more in love with this nugget," he captioned the too-cute photo. "So excited to spend my life with you." END
BEGIN HERE The five-month-pregnant Perlongo, 30, also made an Instagram announcement of her own, sharing a picture of her ring-adorned hand feeding Schulman what appears to be flower petals (not deli meat like we originally thought). "It's all v serious now," she wrote. END
BEGIN HERE Following that meaty snap, the mom-to-be posted another Instagram expressing her excitement over the news, but this time with a totally nude photo (save for the flower petals) that shows off her engagement ring AND pregnancy belly. "Looking through photos from this whirlwind weekend when it finally dawned on me that I'm 5 months pregnant and engaged to the love of my life/best friend/twin clown/source of daily inspiration and so perfectly obnoxiously happy and blessed and giddy," Perlongo, who works in creative advertising, said. "So before I explode into tiny doves I wanted to share with the world what I looked like days before that explosion happens (for forensics etc) Out of breath. Out of words. Out of rose petals but never out of love. Completely floored. I love you endlessly @nevschulman." Followed by a slew of super cute emojis. END
BEGIN HERE When the pair broke their pregnancy news earlier this month, they also confirmed that they were expecting a baby girl with a photo of a sonogram. "Words [can't] capture the excitement and joy I feel about becoming a father," Schulman wrote. "I am so in love with you Laura and thank you for giving me this incredible gift. You inspire and excite me every day." END
BEGIN HERE Perlongo wrote in her blog that the pregnancy was unplanned but wasn't "a complete accident." She said, "We had talked about wanting kids." END
BEGIN HERE Debt is a scary thing. Whether it's credit card debt, car payments, or student loans, nobody likes to talk about what they owe with anybody. But push aside the awkwardness and discomfort, because you have to talk about it with your fiancé. END
BEGIN HERE For years, I've preached how important it is for brides and grooms to be completely open and honest with each other about their finances before they get married. You should be sharing information about all of your assets, too. It's important for the long-term health of your marriage to have a clear understanding of where each of you stand before you link your finances (and credit records) together for the rest of your lives. END
BEGIN HERE I have a good friend whose marriage only lasted a year because the groom didn't tell the bride the extent of his debt prior to the wedding. She didn't leave him because he owed money — she ended the marriage because, after she found out about the almost $50,000 in student loans he'd been dodging for years, he wasn't willing to sit down with her and come up with a plan for how to deal with paying it off. In her mind, they couldn't have kids until they were financially stable, and if he wouldn't even discuss how to solve the problem, they would never solve it and pay it off. END
BEGIN HERE Rather than finding yourself married to the person of your dreams but saddled with debts you had no idea even existed, sit down and have an open conversation ahead of time. There should be zero secrets when you sign the marriage license. END

BEGIN HERE   Golf club memberships, insurance premiums, charitable contributions, and any other significant expenditures that you made regularly as a single person should be evaluated as a couple, and budgeted for together. Once married, it's perfectly acceptable to vary which schools get your contributions, or adjust amounts so that you're both covering your obligations, for example. END

So when the famed designer revealed she had wed at an intimate ceremony in London, we were pleasantly surprised to see the gown she created. The dove-grey lace three quarter length dress, strayed from her more traditional bridal creations, but was no less stunning. Jenny paired the look with shoes of the same color, a short beaded veil, drop earrings, and a gold watch for a graceful bridal look. END

An important thing that couples can do to keep their guests entertained is provide their visitors with a guide of "must sees." In a city like Manhattan, it's pretty difficult to narrow it down to just a few options. To make it a bit easier for you, we've compiled our favorite spots that out-of-town wedding guests should definitely enjoy. END

Really, what's over the top about a towering flower wall, a Versailles rehearsal dinner, and a Florentine big day? Doesn't everyone have a seven-tiered wedding cake? END
BEGIN HERE We're kidding, of course. Kimye's big day will go down as one of the most opulent, excessive, and just plain ridiculous weddings in history. (Which is not to say that we still aren't totally jealous...)

BEGIN HERE If there's one thing we've learned over the years it's that wedding planning can turn even the most balanced brides into total basket cases. While most women don't mean to come off as catty, rude or passive aggressive, sometimes the stress of it all gets taken out on those closest to them, AKA their bridesmaids. So before you let something slip to your BFF that you'll later regret, take a peek at this list and check yourself. END
BEGIN HERE   Again, just because you're on a crazy wedding diet (no judgment here) doesn't mean you have to get all Judge Judy on your bridesmaids about what they eat. One burger isn't going to kill them, but telling them to order the salad might make them want to kill you. So zip it! END

BEGIN HERE   Calling all wannabe Disney princesses: Fairytales do happen. "The commonly accepted rate of divorce is 50 percent, and this gives the impression that the chance of success for every marriage is no better than a coin toss," says Doares. But the actual divorce rate is slightly less than 50 percent, and even better odds are afforded to couples with certain ages, levels of education, and socio-economic statuses, she says. "In addition, there are skills a couple can learn and tools they can use to not just have a marriage that lasts a long time but one that is actually happy," Doares says. END
BEGIN HERE While traditionally, brides are thought of as sweet and innocent, through the years, plenty of celebs have chosen to add some sex appeal to their wedding day style. From Cindy Crawford's tousled beach waves (she was so ahead of her time!), to Jayne Mansfield's show-stopping curves, these famous brides weren't afraid to show off their sexier side when walking down the aisle. And sometimes, like Brigitte Bardot, the sexiness just came from within. We've rounded up 7 celebrity brides who knew that sex appeal was perfectly apropos on their big day. END

BEGIN HERE May 24 marks an important date in history. Yes, May 24, 2014 was the day of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's over-the-top wedding. But an even more iconic event went down years before. 11 years ago today, Tom Cruise leapt up onto Oprah Winfrey's beige couch and seemingly lost his damn mind. But hey, can you really blame the guy? He was in love after all, and no one understands that better than us. END
BEGIN HERE Anyone recall what film the movie star was supposed to be promoting when he stepped out onto Oprah's set on that fateful day? Answer: War of the Worlds. But it's okay if the name of that little Spielberg film slipped your mind, because on May 24, 2005 Cruise's couch jump took center stage. Love will make you do some crazy things... END
BEGIN HERE All it took was for the talkshow host to bring up Cruise's girlfriend at the time — the one and only Katie Holmes — and her apparent affect on the actor's personality. "What has happened to you?" Winfrey asked. His love for Holmes apparently struck Cruise speechless because he responded by pumping his arms in victory and then threw himself down on one knee in a bizarre display of thanks. "Something's happened to you," Winfrey said again, stating what the watching world was thinking. "I'm in love," smiled Cruise. END
BEGIN HERE Cue the crazy. Cue the jumping on the (assumedly expensive) couch. Cue Cruise dragging his soon-to-be bride out onto the stage. Cruise recalled their various romantic dates (a motorcycle ride on the beach, rose petals covering the floor of a hotel in Rome, scuba diving...) between furniture leaps. "You're gone. You are gone," Winfrey kept repeating to her seemingly possessed guest. END

The Hollywood golden couple walked down the aisle in Italy in November 2006, had a daughter, and then split after five years of marriage. END

BEGIN HERE It's not a shocker that we at BRIDES are absolutely obsessed with engagement pictures. Unlike photos on your wedding day, which can sometimes feel posed and rushed, engagement pics allow you, as a couple, to really let your personalities shine through on film. Which is why we were super duper excited to see that the 50 winners of the Best of the Best Engagement Photography Collection from Junebug Weddings were recently released. Warning: your mouth is totally about to drop to the floor. They are THAT stunning. END
BEGIN HERE Now before we take you through some of our utmost faves (which were really, really hard to choose TBH), it's worth noting that this isn't some little photography contest in the U.S. No, Junebug Weddings does it big — we mean REAL BIG. According to BuzzFeed, "the 2016 collection features winners chosen from more than 5,000 image submissions from photographers in 35 different countries" around the world. And to think we had trouble choosing our favorites from a more condensed list of 50. Le sigh. END

BEGIN HERE  Our Favorite Engagement Photo Ideas, From Sweet to Silly END
BEGIN HERE Getting engaged comes with a slew of questions, from friends who are curious about how the question was popped to relatives wondering when and where you'll tie the knot. And while these questions might get old pretty quickly, there are others that plain out rub you the wrong way. One such line of questioning revolves around your engagement ring. Whether it's people asking about the size and quality of the stone or (totally inappropriately) wondering how much it cost, it can feel sort of... gross to have this symbol of your love turned into a matter of material possessions. So how can you respond to people prying about your ring? Our experts weigh in. END
BEGIN HERE Whether you know all the details or not, the specifics of your engagement ring are no one's business but yours and your fiancé's, and it can be frustrating when friends and acquaintances lose sight of what the ring represents and focus on the price tag. END
BEGIN HERE Start by reminding whoever is doing the asking that what matters is what your ring represents. Say something like "You know, I've never thought about what it cost. I just love it, and I love that my fiancé picked it out for me!" to redirect attention to your engagement instead of just your ring. Then change the subject! END
BEGIN HERE If questions about how big the stone is are paired with people wondering whether the stone is real, focus on how much it flatters your hand, or the design details that make it really special. Wearing a stone other than a diamond? You've got every right to explain why you picked morganite or a ruby — or the right to ignore the question! END
BEGIN HERE Of course, if you really don't want to discuss it, say so! Saying you'd rather not talk about the value of the stone is a completely reasonable response, as is replying with your own question and saying "Why do you ask?". They might have a good reason — interest in finding an engagement ring of their own, for example — or they might just be curious, at which point you can say "You know, I'd rather not discuss it," and move on.

BEGIN HERE Five years (to the day!) after Emily Shenk and Jason Flory first met, Emily awoke to a note from her boyfriend that was taped to the bathroom mirror and promised an adventure. "Little did she know, she was about to begin an eight-hour, 13-site scavenger hunt that I had set up all over the D.C. metro area," Jason says. She covered 35 miles worth of locations, all with special meaning to the couple: The bar where they met, the restaurant where they first dined, and even the apartment building in which they had once lived together. At the last stop, Emily found Jason on the steps of the Jefferson Memorial where he waited to join her on a bike ride to their favorite city spot, Hains Point. There, Jason popped the question and received a resounding, "Yes!" END
BEGIN HERE In the end, it was their engagement that solidified their wedding plans. "Just a few weeks after we got engaged, we actually won a local radio contest for best proposal," Emily says. And the prize afforded them far more than just glory. "It had some D.C.-area vendors selected for us, including our venue, so we had to start planning around that." The bride and groom were originally nervous they wouldn't like the pre-selected locale — the Evergreen Country Club in Haymarket, Virginia — but their fears were quickly diminished once they saw the expansive outdoor ceremony space and beautiful interiors. END
BEGIN HERE With their nerves eased and their excitement building, the couple set the date for May 15, 2015, and planned the soft and romantic party they'd envisioned and had Jillian Michelle Photography there to capture every dreamy moment. END

Their simple invitation suite got a special touch: "My mom is a professional calligrapher, among her many other talents, and she volunteered to address our blush pink envelopes in gold ink," Emily says. "She did them so beautifully and so quickly! We were thrilled with how they turned out." The suite matched the couple's overall color palette of gold and pink with pops of merlot. END
BEGIN HERE Because many of their guests had to travel for the big day, Emily and Jason worked hard to make them feel appreciated. "One of the best comments we heard after our wedding was from a mentor of mine," the bride says. "She said she felt like we had a surprise waiting for our guests around every corner. I loved that she felt that way, because that's exactly what we wanted everyone to think." END

END
BEGIN HERE After their first kiss, the new bride and groom found themselves overcome with emotion. "Immediately after the ceremony, we were alone with our parents and the bridal party," Emily says.

When divvying up tasks, play to each other's strengths. Try as best you can to keep things in perspective and approach the engagement experience as just one of many adventures together. No matter how much you plan, little things will inevitably go wrong. While it's fun to aspire to the 'perfect' wedding day, what matters most is all the days that come after." END

BEGIN HERE "Happy wife, happy life" is normally how the saying goes, but in this newlywed blogger's case, it's more like "hot wife, happy husband." Los Angeles writer Amanda Lauren is receiving some backlash for dishing out controversial marriage advice: is the key to a happy marriage simply to "stay hot" for your husband? END
BEGIN HERE Lauren, 33, married her husband, 35-year-old screen writer Ethan Kass, over four months ago, and has promised to "stay hot" for him for the long haul, reports People. "My husband and I probably have a more traditional marriage than most millennials. If I'm there when my husband gets home from work, I love to make him his favorite cocktail (it's kind of Mad Men, but it works for us)," she wrote in her essay, "Staying Hot For My Husband Is ESSENTIAL to a Successful Marriage" on YourTango. "Sunday is my night to cook dinner. But one of the most important things I do to make him happy is to be the woman of both his fantasies and reality." END
BEGIN HERE So far, four months in, it's working for her, albeit being pretty controversial to the rest of the Internet. "I see the look on my husband's face when I come out of the bathroom, ready for a night out, or the way he checks out my butt on the way to Pilates class. Having an attractive wife makes him happy. They say 'Happy wife, happy life,' but I'm happiest when my husband is happy." In return for looking good, she notes her husband is 'attentive' to her needs and buys her nice things, such as a $400 vacuum cleaner. A vacuum, quite the married life perk (eye roll). END
BEGIN HERE After sharing her essay on the relationship site (which caused everyone to lose their minds over her "anti-feminist" stance), Lauren countered, saying, "Being a feminist is about your own choices and saying, 'This is how I'm going to live my life and I'm not going to let anyone dictate it for me. Everyone has their own definition of feminism, that's mine. But I know what's inherently not feminist — bullying other women on the Internet for their life choices." Touché. END
BEGIN HERE Coming to her own defense and calling her message one of empowerment, Lauren says, "I am saying what a lot of women are thinking and no one wants to admit. I hate to say it, but there's a billion-dollar cosmetic and fitness industry. Billions of dollars can't exactly be wrong — women want to improve themselves. There's no question about it: men are visual — at all ages — and they want you to look attractive, and they want their friends to be jealous." END
BEGIN HERE So, on the list of "sexy" maintenance to stay attractive for her man? A hair straightener. "All relationships require work, and working on myself is doing the work I need to do for the sake of my relationship. Even if I'm running 15 minutes behind on date night because my hair isn't straightening, my husband can't complain if he's swooning over me." END
BEGIN HERE But it's not all Louboutins and lipstick at all hours of the day. "I work from home, so I basically have two outfits: workout clothes or shorts," she notes. "There are times when I don't brush my hair. I'm so not glam every minute of the day. But when it comes to going out and going to events, I definitely take an hour or an hour and a half to get ready." END
BEGIN HERE And as far as her husband's goals for keeping svelte and good-looking for his wife? There isn't much that Lauren wants to change or maintain. "My husband's a big guy, but I like big guys. I think he's a teddy bear. He's very much my type. I think people have been so mean about that. I like being in shape, but it's not my thing for men." Sounds like a pretty sweet deal for her husband! END
BEGIN HERE While we can't help but think that her relationship sounds a tad bit superficial, we're hoping it's not the case. Lauren elaborates on their connection, "I've never really had someone who loves me and understands me and wants me to be the happiest I can be until I met him," she shared. "We really support and appreciate each other." END

BEGIN HERE Ah, you've finally reached that fun age where you're hitting the wedding circuit super hard and your savings are sadly taking a hard hit as a result. Welcome to adulthood, y'all! Life is expensive and so are weddings, yep, even if you are just a guest at them. While you don't want to be that friend who shows up empty-handed (or, you know, never sends something in the mail), you do want to be smart about how you spend your money, which means saving wherever you can. So without further adieu, here are our favorite savvy ways to save on wedding gifts. END
BEGIN HERE   Okay, you're not exactly saving per say, but it does feel like free money because, well, it kind of is! If your card offers these rewards, do a quick check to see what your balance is, offers Gallegos. Be it big or small, you can redeem those points for cash to use toward a wedding gift purchase. END

BEGIN HERE Pregnancy can be a stressful time to begin with, so adding family drama is enough to send any expectant mom over the edge. In BabyWeinerDrama's case, conflict with in-laws is making her new arrival a less-than-blissful time. END
BEGIN HERE She's decided that she wants her husband and mom — but nobody else — in the room with her when she gives birth, and her mother-in-law isn't taking that decision so well, to say the least. END
BEGIN HERE "I really like my MIL. She's kind, warm, and funny. She's also incredibly sheltered, a little whiny, and tends to make everything about her, including the birth of my child," she wrote. "My MIL has been up in arms ever since she found out that my mother would be in the delivery room. At first she assumed that she was going to be there, too but I told her, as gently as possible, that I wouldn't be comfortable having her in there as I will be exposed, swearing, sweating, and just generally a mess." END
BEGIN HERE She wont' take "no" for an answer, though. She even tried to convince her son to let her in anyway. BabyWeinerDrama's not sure what would be worse: having her MIL in the room, or continuing this argument.  END
BEGIN HERE Although no one should ever, ever feel pressured to lose weight for that walk down the aisle, a whole slew of brides spend their time as a bride-to-be getting healthy — whether it's to feel confident in their sexy sheath wedding dress or to just start off married life on the right foot. As soon as that engagement ring is slipped on their finger, tons of brides say goodbye to delicious cheeseburgers and crispy french fries. And come their wedding night, they go to bed with not only their just-minted spouse, but with tacos and nachos dancing their heads — all to be consumed ASAP now that they're post-"I do's." Hey, it's the circle of life, alright? And famous fitness blogger Anna Victoria just got way real about it when she posted pics of her before and after wedding body. END
BEGIN HERE The California native and Italy transplant, Anna Victoria, is known for her expert fitness guides, workout inspiration, and her lithe bod that she tweets out to her thousands of followers and posts on her Instagram page. Working out and eating right is definitely a way of life for the blonde beauty. But even fitness gurus can feel the pressure of achieving a wedding ready body. END
BEGIN HERE The night before tying the knot with her now-hubby Luca, Anna Victoria took a quick pic of her totally fit figure, wearing just a pair of black panties and a matching sports bra. (Those abs, though!) "Ready for my dress," she wrote on the snap. That's for sure! One look at the girl in her gorgeous gown and there's seriously no doubt about that. For her big day, the bride donned a slinky lace number that clung to her bod via a chic mermaid silhouette and showed off her strong upper body thanks to its off-the-shoulder design. END
BEGIN HERE But once the "I do's" were said, Ann Victoria's "food baby" finally met its due date, so to speak! The fitness blogger could finally breathe a sigh of relief post-nuptials — and posted a photo to social media proving it. In a side-by-side snapshot, Anna Victoria showed her pre-wedding body and how she looked right after her "I do's," finally relaxed (and presumably full of yummy reception noms!) END
BEGIN HERE How many former brides can relate to that post-wedding belly bloat? After months of dieting, hello fabulous fast food and sugary sweets! END
BEGIN HERE But the point of the pic? "Someone recently said to me that we all have our good angles and we all have our bad angles," the blogger captioned the photos. "So why do we let our bad angles carry so much more weight than our good angles? If you focus on how bad you look in the bad angles, at least focus on how good you look in the good ones too!" END
BEGIN HERE Several of her followers commended her for showing them her 'sitting belly'. END
BEGIN HERE One Instagram user said: "Finally! Someone who shows her sitting belly as well. I was starting to think that there was something wrong with mine...thank you this is real fitness motivation!" END
BEGIN HERE Another user commented: "Perfect example of how we should always be gentle to ourselves." END
BEGIN HERE Even more users on Facebook said that her photo makes them feel better about their own bodies, The Daily Mail reports, with a few adding that the photo has made them realize they're beautiful too. END
BEGIN HERE "Tag a friend if you found this helpful," Anna Victoria instructed. Brides of the world, we're tagging all of you! END
BEGIN HERE  The Downsides of Extreme Wedding Weight Loss END
BEGIN HERE If you're on the fence about inviting your ex, it's usually best to not. "Exes are a reason that relationships break up, and inviting them to your wedding can be tempting fate," warns April Masini, relationship and etiquette expert. "Typically, when a relationship ends, and a new one begins, there's no reason to have your ex at your wedding. Moving on means leaving your ex behind — and off the guest list — when you remarry." END
BEGIN HERE But there are exceptions to every rule. And Masini believes there are three to this one. Check them out and see if your long-lost-love should make your guest list. END
BEGIN HERE   You know how you added your mean Great Aunt Sally only because you know she won't come? You can apply the same rule to your ex. Says Masini, "Sometimes your ex lives in another country and you're just Skype friends or Christmas card friends." That distance — whether physical or emotional — is key. "You both have separate lives, and the invitation is a formality that won't be followed up with attendance," explains Masini. "It's fine to extend the invitation in these circumstances as a matter of etiquette and civility." END
BEGIN HERE When the Wizarding World of Harry Potter — a recreation of everything found in the books and films, such as the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy, and even Diagon Alley — opened at Universal Orlando Resort back in June of 2010, the HP fanatics of the world literally could not EVEN. Most fans booked their tickets ASAP to taste some butterbeer and find a "unique" wand to call their own (for a hefty price, of course), flooding Facebook and Twitter with glorious views of their fandom. And as much as we just looove looking at the broom you purchased before riding through a 3D version of Gringotts Bank, we have to say this adorbs engagement shoot takes the cake. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Kevin Cucci    END
BEGIN HERE Though not as exciting as the couple who cradled frozen meat at Costco for their engagement shoot, Michele Matthews and her fiancé, Jared Grunwald, took their obsession with the world of magic to a whole new level by having their photographer take the sweetest, most magical pics of them at the theme park. END
BEGIN HERE "I have read the series like six times, own all the movies, and usually kick butt at any form of Harry Potter trivia," Matthews told BuzzFeed. "Jared also really enjoys the series, but he isn't as nerdy as I am! He loves to do Harry Potter-related things for me, he's taken me to shows and events, he's bought me clothes and trinkets, all just to put a smile on my face." END
BEGIN HERE Ummm, where do WE find a guy like this?! END
BEGIN HERE On one of the couple's many trips to the theme park every year, they decided to bring along Grunwald's best friend Kevin Cucci, a professional photographer, to take a few fun pictures of them exploring their fave place. But it didn't come without difficulties. END
BEGIN HERE Cucci told BuzzFeed that it was pretty hard to avoid all of the parkgoers waltzing into his clients' shots. "We got there early in the day so it wasn't as busy, but there were still a bunch of people there." I mean, come on peeps... In the name of love and all that Harry P stands for you'd think you could respect an engagement photo shoot! END
BEGIN HERE But despite all of the challenges, Cucci managed to produce some pretty stellar shots. Just take a look for yourself. Accio! END

BEGIN HERE Most brides start planning a wedding having never done it or thought about it in detail before. After all, there's not a lot of need for knowing the difference between escort cards and place cards outside of the wedding world! But what about the wedding pros? With their years of experience planning, designing, documenting, and paying attention to the details of countless other brides' weddings, these engaged ladies must have it all figured out, right? Well, it turns out even wedding professionals learn a thing or two along the way, so we got in touch with a few of our favorites to find out what they've picked up on the path to "I do." END
BEGIN HERE   "It's a celebration of your love and union," says Cruz. "It's easy to get caught up in the music, the flowers, and the little details, but none of that is as important as the person you'll be saying 'I do' to." Adds Wilson, "Relax and take in the experience of being a bride. Focus on marrying your best friend and celebrating with your family and friends. Don't worry about anything, grab a drink, and go have fun!" Fernie concludes, "When I see a bride getting flustered, I tell her to close her eyes, think of her groom, and focus on the relationship and love that they share — it's the best way to calm down!"

BEGIN HERE Dancing with the Stars pros Peta Murgatroyd and Maksim Chmerkovskiy may be expanding their dance team in the very near future! Multiple sources have shared the engaged dancers are pregnant with their first child. Congratulations to this cute, to-be-wed duo! END
BEGIN HERE Murgatroyd, 29, and Chmerkovskiy, 36, recently got engaged — and now are adding a baby to the mix, Us Weekly reports. This doesn't come as much of a surprise, as the two had been discussing having children in the near future. "I would like to start having kids pretty soon. A little boy, and then a little girl," [Murgatroyd said right after their whirlwind engagement. END
BEGIN HERE The road to married life (and now parenthood) wasn't always an easy one. Murgatroyd's first thoughts on her fiancé were less-than-stellar at first. "I thought he was arrogant. I learned to like him because I found out he wasn't that arrogant. He was really generous to the entire cast, and our friendship grew and grew," she admitted. The dancing duo worked together as friends for a long time — including when Chmerkovskiy was engaged to DWTS pro Karina Smirnoff and Murgaroyd was dating DWTS castmate Damien Whitewood. END
BEGIN HERE But her hubby-to-be doesn't agree with her first impression sentiments, retorting, "Okay, that's a defense mechanism. I think she was in love with me at first sight and just doesn't want to admit it." And it seems Murgatroyd's change of heart was the real deal, because she has been totally smitten ever since — even when Chmerovskiy tried to break things off after less than a year of dating! "My heart was broken. But when we were driving to the airport after the breakup talk, he literally asked me why I was taking all my bags and clothes back. I was like, 'We just broke up. Why would I leave anything behind?' That's when I knew it wasn't really over for forever." END
BEGIN HERE Luckily for the two, who met when they were cast in the Broadway production Burn the Floor, the breakup lasted less than three months, and the stars aligned (no pun intended). In December, while on the dance floor during DWTS (because, where else?), Chmerovskiy proposed with a gorgeous engagement ring in front of their fellow costars and the shocked viewers around the world on live television. The life-changing moment was caught on tape — something that every bride dreams to have happen, that's for sure. END
BEGIN HERE "I wanted it to be kind of like a surprise for everybody," the professional dancer shared. "Everybody had an amazing moment that was very unforgettable and things like this need to be unforgettable. It needs to be special." Swoon. The couple is planning on tying the knot in a big celebration in Los Angeles, with a date and details TBD. END
BEGIN HERE Since their perfect proposal moment, Chmerovskiy has been sharing adorable Instagram snaps of his leading lady, captioned, "She's perfect...I'm a '+1,'" "#wcw everyday @petamurgatroyd, and "fiancé.'" With the adoration these two have for each other, we're sure their little baby will be very loved (let alone having killer moves on the dance floor, of course)! END
BEGIN HERE Get ready to fall in love with smooth, glowing skin for your wedding day! Of course you want picture-perfect skin on your big day, and the only way to achieve that is to get started on the right skin care regimen months ahead of the wedding day. From age-fighting supplements to exfoliating wizards, it's time to get serious about your skin care. END
BEGIN HERE Here are four simple steps to add to your pre-wedding routine now for glowing skin by the time you walk down the aisle. END
BEGIN HERE   And lest you forget that more than just your face will be on display on the Big Day; it's time to add serious body hydration to your skin care routine. An antioxidant-packed lotion like TimeWise Body® Targeted-Action® Toning Lotion keeps skin hydrated for 24-hours (who has time to reapply lotion when you've got wedding day festivities to enjoy?). Açai berries and green tea fight free radicals and actually help skin look more defined and toned. END
BEGIN HERE Planning a wedding is stereotypically a mother-daughter activity. Dress shopping, picking out napkins, registering for china... probably not things your dad would get super excited about, right? But his little girl is growing up, too, and finding ways to include him in this big moment in your life can be incredibly meaningful. So how can you include dear old Dad in the planning process? Here are a few ideas from our experts. END
BEGIN HERE Who says dress shopping is a girls-only event? If you and your dad are particularly close, consider bringing him along with Mom while you're trying on wedding dress after wedding dress. He might lean more traditional and insist you try on that gown that looks like the princess dresses you wore as a little girl, or he just might be the one pushing you out of your comfort zone and into something unexpected and modern! END
BEGIN HERE If Dad isn't a fashion buff, consider including him in other aspects that might be right up his alley. You could bring him along to the menu tasting or, if he's a wine connoisseur, include him in your discussions of what will be poured at the table and served at the bar that night. END
BEGIN HERE Does your dad love music? Ask him to help listen to sample tracks from bands you're considering or, if they're doing a showcase or playing locally, invite him to come with you to hear them play live. And if you've got a father who loves classic cars (and might even own one!), see if he might lend you the keys for your getaway or help you pick from the options at your local limo company. END
BEGIN HERE Of course, there are also Dad-specific details he can help with, like choosing a song for the father-daughter dance or making a plan for your father-daughter first look. Play to his strengths and figure out what he'd be excited to help with, and you'll be golden! END
BEGIN HERE Designing and planning a wedding comes easily to some brides, especially those who are particularly creative — and Addison, a Dallas-based ballet dancer and choreographer, is no exception! After Jeremy proposed on her birthday in November of 2014, she jumped feet-first into planning their September 27, 2015, wedding for 135 guests. "I'm a creator at heart, and building our vision was so exciting!" she says. "If I ever have to pick another profession, it will definitely be event design." END
BEGIN HERE She and Jeremy have celebrated their son, Hudson's, first two birthdays at the Dallas Arboretum, and they knew it was just the place for a wedding. "We were inspired by the easy elegance of the gorgeous, natural space," says Addison. She wove in lush florals and mid-century modern details, creating a '60s Palm Springs vibe. With mixed metallic and rich fall hues layered against geometric details and the garden's sculptures and fountains, we'd have to say they nailed it! Take a look at this sweet, family-focused celebration, photographed by Sarah Delanie. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Sarah Delanie    END
BEGIN HERE Addison was totally giddy when she slipped on this Monique Lhuillier ball gown, with a beaded bodice and a structured tulle skirt. "I went shopping with my hair and makeup done, which helped me see how the dress would look on our wedding day," she says. She added a matching beaded cathedral-length veil, which paired perfectly with the elegance of her stunning yellow diamond engagement ring. END
BEGIN HERE Jeremy wore a Ralph Lauren tuxedo, which he topped off with a wine-colored ranunculus boutonniere. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Sarah Delanie    END
BEGIN HERE "I'm so happy we decided to do a first look," says Addison. "I was so nervous and excited, my lips were quivering as we kissed!" It was the perfect opportunity for the ballerina to show off her dance floor-ready skirt, and for Jeremy to flaunt his blue loafers and pocket square. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Sarah Delanie    END
BEGIN HERE The bride's voluminous bouquet combined roses and ranunculus in ivory, blush, deep pink, and wine hues, with cascading ivy and ribbons. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Sarah Delanie    END
BEGIN HERE "We had the ceremony in the Women's Sculpture Garden, surrounded by ponds, fountains, and gorgeous sculptures. We loved the natural beauty, so we didn't bring in any décor," says the bride. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Sarah Delanie    END
BEGIN HERE The groom walked down the aisle with the couple's son, followed by the bride and her father. Although they had a traditional ceremony, they capped off the proceedings by sharing vows that included their son. "Holding Hudson together during the last part of our vows, and seeing tears in Jeremy's eyes as he said his vows to me, is one of my favorite memories," says the bride. "It was beautiful to see our community come together to support our little family." END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Sarah Delanie    END
BEGIN HERE For the reception, the pair hosted a modern garden party, lit by candles and café lights. "We wanted the tables to be rich and full, but didn't want anything higher than eye level," Addison explains of the low garland design. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Sarah Delanie    END
BEGIN HERE Smoke-gray chargers, black napkins, and sleek wine glasses lent a crisp and classic feel to the reception. The floral garlands combined roses and ranunculus with natural greenery. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Sarah Delanie    END
BEGIN HERE The bride and groom's chairs were decked out with swags of roses, while cocktail tables were topped with gold geometric vessels full of blooms. Guests sipped either an Old Fashioned or a gin cocktail made with St. Germain and cucumber. For dinner, everyone dined on steak, shrimp, and Cajun pasta. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Sarah Delanie    END
BEGIN HERE The square-edged cake had a bottom tier covered in ombré black-to-white frosting with an organic texture, topped with gold geometric details and a cluster of fresh blooms. The flavor was perfect for a fall wedding: Pumpkin spice cake with vanilla cream and blackberry jam. There was also a dessert table topped with brownie bites and macarons. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Sarah Delanie    END
BEGIN HERE "Jeremy and I danced to 'Our Love is Here to Stay,' by Natalie Cole," says Addison. And of course she took time to dance with Hudson, too! END
BEGIN HERE The Blood Moon in the sky cast a magical glow over the evening. Says the bride, "Keep the joy in what you are planning. Cherish the love you have for each other and the journey to the altar — and stay under budget! It will keep stress at bay." END

BEGIN HERE Last year was a rough one for Patrick Dempsey fans. First, viewers had to bid the saddest of goodbyes Dr. McDreamy on Grey's Anatomy. And then, even more heartbreaking, Dempsey's wife Jillian Fink filed for divorce after three kids and an impressive 15 years of marriage. Call us crazy, but we were rooting for the reunion of these two even more than we were for Grey's Anatomy's Mer and Der when they broke up the first time (and the second, and the third...). And apparently, our reconciliation wish has been granted! Dempsey just gave us a major relationship status update, and it has us seriously smiling. END
BEGIN HERE Reunion rumors between Dempsey and Fink first started swirling when the former Grey's Anatomy actor was spotted out and about with his wedding ring still safely around his finger. Then, around the time when Dempsey was shooting Bridget Jones' Baby in the U.K., he was seen holding hands with his almost-ex-wife in Paris. And back in February, the twosome was spotted engaged in some pretty serious PDA while aboard a yacht in St. Barts on a family vacation. It certainly didn't look like they were calling it quits to us, but now it's certain: The pair are officially back together! END
BEGIN HERE In a legal document snagged by Entertainment Tonight, the judge presiding over their case declared that if Fink does not move forward with their divorce filings, he would dismiss the case. Dempsey later confirmed the reunion news to ES Magazine when asked if he and his wife are back together. "Yeah, I think so," the actor replied. END
BEGIN HERE But, like any marriage, Dempsey admitted that his is taking some work. "You have to work at everything," he explained. "And you cannot do everything. Something has to be sacrificed." END
BEGIN HERE Well, whatever sacrifices were made, we're happy they made them. Here's to another 15 years! END

BEGIN HERE Christopher Columbus's first landing point in the New World was the Bahamas, so why not follow his lead and set off on your first adventure as husband and wife to the very same spot, settling down in the capital city of Nassau for your honeymoon. Sitting on the 11th largest island in the Bahamas, the 21-mile-long New Providence, Nassau really is a couples' paradise, with its sweeping white-sand shores, pristine beaches, shipwreck-filled dive sites, and cuisine that has a flavor all of its own. END
BEGIN HERE You may recognize some of these sandy stretches from scenes of Pirates of the Caribbean, but the island was also once home to a slew of real-life pirates of the Caribbean, including one of the most famous of them all — Captain John Howard Graysmith, who built the historic Graycliff Mansion in 1740. Nowadays Graycliff serves as a tucked-away, five-star hotel with just 20 rooms, making it an intimate outpost for honeymooners heading to the island. Inspired by this colonial gem, we've whipped up 10 other reasons why you should pack your bikini and book a flight to the Bahamas to cozy up in your very own mansion digs during the ultimate island honeymoon in Nassau. END
BEGIN HERE   You'll already be basking on one of the Bahamas' 700 islands, but that doesn't mean you can't explore a few of the others while you're there. Why not start with your own private one? Cruise by high-speed powerboat to Ship Channel Cay, set 38 nautical miles from Nassau, for a day of honeymoon bliss where all you have to decide is whether you'd rather feast on island specialties, feed the stingrays or sip wine while soaking up the sun from the porch of a gorgeous little fishing cottage. END
BEGIN HERE Some brides and grooms plan every detail of their big day together. Sometimes, the bride does the bulk of the planning work, but the groom participates in making big decisions. Every once awhile, the groom has no clue what the bride has planned for their wedding weekend until it arrives, and they're both just fine with that. END
BEGIN HERE In fact, as long as the bride and groom are comfortable, it doesn't matter if the groom has a single clue of what's going to happen once the wedding festivities start. It's okay if he has the "tell me where to be and when" philosophy if the bride's agreed to that. It means she can plan whatever she wants, no questions asked. The only time it becomes a problem is when the wedding festivities begin, and the groom continues to behave as though he were a guest instead of the host.  END
BEGIN HERE  You are half of the couple creating this lifetime union, and you have to be your future wife's wing-man on the wedding weekend. You have to deal with your family and their drama, and you have to respond to messages and calls from your friends and relatives. The bride has her own drama and stress managing her guests — and running the wedding if she doesn't have a planner. END
BEGIN HERE A groom can't be a wedding guest at his own wedding, even if he wants to be. Even if you were lucky enough to escape stuffing wedding invitations, writing thank you notes, and making sure wedding party gifts were purchased and wrapped, that's all the slack you get. When the real wedding weekend is upon you, it's time to start acting like a groom. END

No matter the reason you're in favor of a brunch wedding, consider these five points before you commit to throwing an A.M. affair. END

First, you can keep the party going by transitioning from brunch to another activity, like relaxing in cabanas by the pool. Or, you can signal the party's over by jetting off on your honeymoon and leaving guests free to spend the rest of the day however they'd like. Consider setting up a tour of the city or including suggestions of what to do after the wedding in the welcome bags, Domino says. "Happy wedding guests are informed wedding guests," she says. "As long as they know what's going on, they're going to be fine and enjoy it." END

BEGIN HERE If you want to form a lasting relationship, it might feel like there's a lot of pressure on that first date. But according to a new study by the dating site PlentyOfFish, you don't need to do anything extravagant with someone for you two to have long-term potential. In fact, of all the first dates people can go on, the most popular among now-married couples are the simplest. END
BEGIN HERE The study, which included 1,100 former PlentyOfFish users who are now married, found that more than 65 percent of them went out for a meal or apps on their first date with the person who is now their spouse. The second-most popular date was going for a walk, followed by coffee or drinks — all minimalistic activities that make your conversation the main event. And, according to psychotherapist Katherine Schafler, that's what makes these dates so effective. END
BEGIN HERE "Less is more when it comes to first dates," she says. "The less complicated the interaction is, the more likely it is for a potential partnership to emerge because you're not distracted, leaving you more able to focus on the other person, how you feel around them, and whether an attraction is building." END
BEGIN HERE While there's something to be said for cute date activities, you might want to save these for the second, third, or fourth dates, when you've already gotten to know each other a bit more. Why? "When you choose big activities for a first date, it's possible you focus a little more on whether you like the activity as opposed to the person you're doing the big activity with," Schafler says.

BEGIN HERE And another one bites the dust... There's nothing more we hate doing than bidding farewell to our favorite celebrity couples and Johnny Depp and Amber Heard — who just announced their divorce — are no exception. We hate that these two are calling it quits! And since we need a chance to mourn the whirlwind romance between the blonde beauty and the brooding movie star, we're taking a look back on their warm and romantic Bahamian destination wedding day. END
BEGIN HERE After a year of marriage, Heard has filed for divorce from her husband after a year of marriage, according to CNN, citing irreconcilable differences and requesting spousal support. But today, we're focusing on happier times, back to when Heard and Depp tied the knot on the groom's private island in the Bahamas. END
BEGIN HERE Depp and Heard met while shooting the 2011 film The Rum Diary and began dating the following year. The twosome later got engaged in early 2014, with Depp confirming the news when he was spotted wearing his fiancé's diamond sparkler. "The fact that I'm wearing a chick's ring on my finger is probably a dead giveaway. Not very subtle," Depp told a reporter when asked if he was getting hitched, becoming one of the first celebs we know of to rock the "man-gagement" ring trend. END
BEGIN HERE After a year long engagement, Heard and Depp finally tied the knot in February of 2015 in one of those secret celebrity weddings that we really are getting sick of over here. (We want all the photos, y'all!) The pair got married in a quiet civil ceremony at their home in Los Angeles, before heading to Little Hall's Pond Cay island in the Bahamas for a second ceremony and reception with their family and close friends. END
BEGIN HERE The bride walked down the sandy, seaside aisle wearing a Stella McCartney wedding dress. Meanwhile the groom donned a white tuxedo jacket as they tied the knot under a canopy of fresh blooms and gauzy white fabric, on a stretch of land Depp dubbed Amber Beach after his love. END
BEGIN HERE "Amber did her own hair and make-up and Johnny was as laid-back as usual," a source divulged of the big day. Talk about a calm, cool, and collected couple! They also kept their guest list to a minimum, only inviting about 50 guests, including Jennifer Connolly's husband, actor Paul Bettany, and Depp's two children, who enjoyed sunning themselves on the beach and snorkeling all wedding weekend long. END
BEGIN HERE "She's a wonderful girl," Depp previously told NBC's Today show of his bride. "She's sharp as a tack. A southern belle and sweet as can be, and very good for me." END

BEGIN HERE Between fielding in-law requests, avoiding wedding day disasters, and calling in for swift back-up when a vendor suddenly goes AWOL, we're convinced that a bride-to-be could run an army if she wanted. But as crazy and chaotic as wedding planning can be, it pales in comparison to the lives of the actual military men and women who serve our country on the reg. Truth be told, nothing sets our hearts quite so aflutter than military weddings. The moving time-honored traditions, the dashing ceremonial dress uniforms, all the beautiful formality... Sigh. That's why we're saluting our soldiers this Memorial Day with our newest BRIDES video, featuring a heartfelt look back at military weddings through the ages. Forward, march! (And cue the tears...) END
BEGIN HERE We always find vintage wedding photos totally swoon-worthy, but vintage military wedding photos definitely take the (wedding) cake! Between the bride's flirty and flouncy '60s mod wedding dress, the vintage bridal headwear, and the old-school armed forces uniforms, we're giving these retro, romantic military pics the highest of rankings. END
BEGIN HERE But we're also sending off a sweet salute to the modern day military weddings because, guys, these photos are just too darn gorgeous. But one common thread throughout these decades of military "I dos" is the traditional saber arch, in which the pair of newlyweds are ushered into their new life by passing under the raised swords of their military brethren. Y'all know we're suckers for sweet wedding day traditions! END
BEGIN HERE When you think about how many unique sacrifices and obstacles military couples face throughout their marriages — heart-wrenching separations, countless nights spent worrying for their spouse over seas, seemingly endless work hours... — those wedding vows can suddenly take on an even deeper meaning. So salute these military twosomes along with us and check out these too-sweet wedding photos we can't stop fawning over. S.O.S., we're swooning... END

BEGIN HERE Lindsay Lohan is certainly living the good life lately! The Mean Girls star was recently seen on Instagram celebrating her rumored fiancé Egor Tarabasov's 23rd birthday and flaunting her outfit for the occasion, which of course gave us a much-needed peek at her emerald not-an-engagement-ring ring. The 29-year-old actress and her Russian beau have been gallivanting around town (errr...France and New York) and looking more in love than ever. END
BEGIN HERE Back in April, the rumors were swirling about Lilo's relationship status with her 22-year-old boyfriend of several months. They had been spotted at a Duran Duran concert in Brooklyn while visiting her family in New York, and Lohan was seen sporting some very sparkly green bling (5 carats, to be exact!). Lohan's rep denied the engagement at first, but her friends had other things to say... END
BEGIN HERE The ring in question is an oval-shaped ring with an emerald center stone surrounded by a diamond halo, and you can tell the future Mrs. Tarabasov really loves her green sparkler, as she recently captioned an Instagram snap,"Emerald Stone- "All the#Green of nature is concentrated within the Emerald" -St. Hildegard of Bengin (noted lithologist)_ a stone of inspiration and infinite patience." Clearly she's channeling the zen. END
BEGIN HERE And just like her (lack of a public) engagement announcement, her man's rumored proposal was out of the public eye, although very special. Friends close to The Parent Trap actress told US Weekly, "It was a big proposal, but it wasn't done in public. Lindsay texted a friend a picture of the ring." END
BEGIN HERE Even though they've only been dating for several months, the pair are pretty hot and heavy for each other and have a lot in common (including their apparent love for cigarettes). Recently, Lohan and Tarabasov, who reside in London, were seen in NYC enjoying a smoke break together — and also jet-setting to the South of France, where they were canoodling on a boat together in Cannes. END
BEGIN HERE As far as their parents' thoughts, Lilo's mom, Dina, seems over-the-moon about her daughter's special guy. "He's very mature, very worldly. They love each other." Lindsay's father, Michael, also shared, "I haven't seen Lindsay this happy in a very, very long time." END
BEGIN HERE According to an email from Lohan's rep to BRIDES, the actress is not engaged. END
BEGIN HERE We'd like to think that the days of complaint-worthy bridesmaid dresses are now behind us, and that gone too, are the days of brides feeling obligated to narrow down their bridesmaid search to one dress, one style, and one color. While we still love the classic, clean look of a uniform bridal party, we are definitely also fans of embracing the latest bridesmaid dress trend — mismatched styles and colors. There are many ways to jump on this trend and ensure each of your girls love their look AND feel their best on your big day. END
BEGIN HERE   If you're going to commit to a trend, go all out, right? For a really stunning look incorporate both different designs AND colors into your bridal party ensemble. For this option, you can stick within the same family and play with different tones and hues or use the palate of your wedding inspiration while shopping and selecting. Just be certain that once all dresses are selected, you have the time to see them together — a bit of cohesiveness is key here. Don't forget the flowers! When it comes to both different cuts and color in your maids' dresses, the perfect way to tie it all together is with neutral and simple bouquets. END
BEGIN HERE If there's one couple we have been dying to see walk down the aisle (other than Milliam, obvi) it's Demi Lovato and her beau Wilmer Valderrama, or as we like to call him, Feeeeez. Engagement rumors have been circulating around the couple for months now, and the celeb gossip only seems to be catching more momentum after the "Confident" singer appeared at a slew of press events on Wednesday, according to People Style. Lovato, who wanted to glam up her look a bit, donned sparkling diamond accessories, which just so happened to include a gorgeous ring worn on her right finger. Why a ring worn on her right finger would create such a buzz is beyond our explanation, but regardless, the duo's fans immediately jumped the gun saying it MUST be a sign of engagement. END
BEGIN HERE Much to our disappointment though, Lovato was there to shut all of the rumors down — in the sassiest way possible, of course! Taking to her Snapchat account, the former Disney star snapped a pic of the so-called engagement ring, which turned out to simply be a massive, sparky accessory. Obviously becoming frustrated with all of the gossip surrounding her relationship, Lovato wrote "RELAX" to quiet everyone and set things straight. Can you really blame her? END
BEGIN HERE Demi Lovato Address Those Wilmer Valderrama Engagement Rumors END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Demi Lovato Snapchat    END
BEGIN HERE This isn't the first time the star has had to shut down engagement rumors, either. But after appearing on Ellen back in February, she did reveal she would be more than open to the idea. "I don't see a ring," Lovato confessed on the show. "I wouldn't mind if I saw one! There's time for everything, you know. We've been together this long, and obviously I"m not going anywhere and vice versa." END
BEGIN HERE So in all actuality, maybe we're not the only ones waiting patiently for a Lovato and Valderrama wedding. Here's to hoping all of her bridal dreams come true soon! END
BEGIN HERE There are plenty of reasons brides, grooms, and planners alike love tented weddings — the ambience, the cozy intimate air, and the whole party (and all the wedding décor) is safe from the elements! But erecting a wedding structure isn't like putting together the tent you and your fiancé use when you go camping. It takes a lot of work, and requires just as much preparation and planning. For example: Love the look of a clear top tent? While a see-through structure (like the one above, decorated by famous planner Mindy Weiss) is great at bringing the outdoors in at your event, it also acts as a greenhouse, trapping warm air and posing a threat to those wilt-able flowers. Or perhaps you're worried that your tent might be too big for your party size? Add warm lighting to make a massive tent appear cozy and intimate. To get started on planning your own canopied big day, take note of these 10 other need-to-know things about tented weddings. END
BEGIN HERE Traditionally, the bride's family pays for the wedding and the groom's pays for the rehearsal dinner the night before. But what happens when both sets of parents are splitting the cost of the wedding? Our experts have a few ideas. END
BEGIN HERE If both sets of parents are splitting the cost of the wedding 50-50, the same should apply to surrounding wedding events, like the rehearsal dinner and the morning-after brunch. If that's the way you decide to split things, both sets of parents should act as hosts at all events, including having their names included with equal billing on the invitations. END
BEGIN HERE You could simply have the parents divide the costs evenly once all is said and done, or you could create a list of wedding costs and designate who will be paying for what, such as the bride's family paying for the invitations and the groom's family covering the alcohol. If you plan to include the rehearsal dinner as part of the divided costs, be sure to include it on the list when you're divvying up expenses. You could also opt to have the groom's parents host the rehearsal dinner, the bride's parents host the morning-after brunch, and both sets of parents host the wedding together. END
BEGIN HERE If the event isn't being split evenly (for example, if the bride's family is covering the venue rental and catering, with the groom's family paying for the flowers), the couple making the smaller contribution may want to offer to cover the costs of the rehearsal dinner. END
BEGIN HERE Another option would be for the bride and groom to pay for the rehearsal dinner themselves, serving as hosts for this welcome event. It can be as formal or as relaxed as you'd like, but it's a nice way to show your appreciation for the costs your parents are undergoing. END
BEGIN HERE  5 Simple Ways to Make Your Rehearsal Dinner Unforgettable END
BEGIN HERE Texts are incredibly convenient ways to communicate. But those tiny messages can get you in big trouble. "The reality is that text neglect, text abuse, and text dynamics can become the one violin string playing in the background of a relationship and can also be the straw that breaks the camel's back when other problems are present," warns April Masini, relationship and etiquette expert. And with that in mind, she says, here are five texts you should never send to your spouse. END
BEGIN HERE   When it comes to texting, tell the whole story or no story at all, says Masini. "Don't text half the story and leave him hanging. For instance, don't text, 'I think I'm having a heart attack,' and nothing. You're going to give him one with that kind of communication," she says. "Don't text him, 'I think your mother eloped,' and nothing else. It's going to create anxiety and it's much kinder to say nothing, or tell the whole story." END
BEGIN HERE It's no wonder why summer is the most popular season to tie the knot. The flowering blooms, the shining sun, and alfresco venues are all understandably and universally beloved by brides and grooms — even those of the celebrity set! One of our favorite engaged celebrity twosomes are said to have officially set their wedding date for this summer — and they even have their venue all picked out! Former New York Yankee Derek Jeter and his fiancé,Sports Illustrated model Hannah Davis, are set to wed this July and it sounds like it's shaping up to be the wedding of the season. END
BEGIN HERE The baseball hunk and the swimsuit model have stayed pretty hush-hush on their wedding day details thus far. Heck, despite the popped question rumors, we weren't even sure if they were engaged until Jeter accidentally dropped the F-word (fiancé that is!) during an interview last November and Davis was spotted toting a four to six carat round-cut engagement ring (estimated to have cost around $150,000-$300,000) around town. We were starving for details back in February when Davis finally revealed that Vera Wang will be the lucky lady who'll design her wedding dress. But now we've finally got the low-down on the 'when' and the 'where,' too! Drumroll, please... END

While we all know that wedding cake tastes delicious with a cool glass of champagne, with bakers getting more and more creative with their flavor combinations, we knew there had to be other beverages that would be just as delicious alongside a decadent slice.

BEGIN HERE When Lana Powers attended her cousin's wedding in New York City in February of 2011, she didn't expect to spend the whole night on the dance floor with Steve Shears, a charming stranger. But that fateful encounter, and their hours of dancing, paid off and Lana and Steve's relationship quickly blossomed. Three years later, on July 11, 2014, Steve planned to recreate the couple's first official date at Euzkadi, an intimate East Village restaurant. After ordering a fine bottle of wine and reminiscing about their relationship, Steve got down on one knee and proposed. Lana tearfully accepted the proposal and was so overjoyed that she admits she barely noticed the stunning engagement ring Steve was holding. END
BEGIN HERE As they started planning their August 8, 2015, wedding, Lana and Steve kept a chic, romantic, and modern aesthetic in mind. "I always knew that I wanted everything to be white with pops of grey, glimmer and sparkle, and tons of candles," the bride says, so they chose a venue that lived up to such glamorous treatment: New York City's Metropolitan Club, which overlooks Central Park. Read on to see every last beautiful detail photographed by Meg Miller Photography. END
BEGIN HERE As a publicist, Lana had planned many large-scale events and felt confident that she could turn her vision a reality, so she planned most of the details on her own but knew when to call in backup. Family friend and planner, Monique Banks, lent a hand in the weeks leading up to the big day and florist Emily Pinon of Bastille Flowers & Events helped the bride select flowers, vases, linens, and everything in between. END
BEGIN HERE "Steve and I are a really fun couple and love to party, so it was important to us that our wedding was incredibly fun for all attendees," the bride says. "We wanted everyone on the dance floor at all times!" END
BEGIN HERE Lana knew she wanted her wedding dress to be a sophisticated showstopper. After shopping at a handful of stores, she tried on a sexy ivory Lazaro gown with a jeweled illusion back, beaded trim, and cathedral-length train and immediately knew it was her dress. "I've always loved Lazaro, so I wasn't surprised when I chose my dress," she says. "As soon as I saw this one on me, I didn't look back." She paired the detailed wedding dress with a simple tulle veil for the ceremony and embellished Sergio Rossi sandals. END
BEGIN HERE Instead of a traditional bouquet, the bride carried a trailing arrangement of white orchids and crystals. END
BEGIN HERE Steve wore a navy blue custom tuxedo with black satin lapels and a black bowtie, while his groomsmen wore traditional black tuxedos with bowties. Lana's bridesmaids wore matching Adrianna Papell sequined gowns, a nod to the wedding's sparkling vibe. Each woman carried a trailing orchid arrangement that was similar to the bride's, but without the addition of glittering crystals. END
BEGIN HERE A pianist and flutist performed Florence and the Machine's "You've Got the Love" as both bride and groom walked down the aisle with their respective parents. The bride and groom wrote and recited their own vows for the ceremony; Lana's included a quote from her favorite musical "The Last Five Years," moving nearly everyone to tears. "There wasn't a dry eye in the house and everyone kept telling us that was one of the most unique, emotional, and special aspects of our wedding," the bride says. END
BEGIN HERE The reception décor was certainly as Lana and Steve envisioned — every inch of the Metropolitan Club was brimming with sparkle and glimmering candles. Sequined tablecloths covered the guests' tables, shimmering brightly under the romantically-lit room. END
BEGIN HERE The couple's head table stood out from the rest thanks to a frame-inspired arrangement of white roses and hanging crystal globes. For dinner, everyone enjoyed miso-glazed Sea Bass and strip steak paired with fresh veggies. END
BEGIN HERE After the couple took their first twirl as husband and wife to Jack's Mannequin's "No Man is an Island," Lana shared a dance with her father while Steve invited his mother to the dance floor. The bride and her father chose Coldplay's "Viva La Vida" since it's representative of their family's motto while Steve and his mother shared a moment on the dance floor to "I Hope You Dance" by Lee Ann Womack. END
BEGIN HERE A drummer since the age of 10, the groom joined the Karen Lloyd Band on stage to play hits like Bon Jovi's "Livin' on a Prayer" and Journey's "Don't Stop Believing" while his bride danced and sang along on stage. "We wanted the dance floor filled all night," Lana says. "This wedding was all about entertainment and matchmaking!" END
BEGIN HERE The couple's four-tiered yellow wedding cake (which was filled with a tasty berry compote and chocolate mousse!) was embellished with edible silver beads. Guests with a sweet tooth had their choice of plenty of other desserts, too, including ice cream sandwiches, cookies, fresh fruit, and cheesecake pops. END
BEGIN HERE The celebration didn't stop there. The couple also hosted an after party which was fueled by late night snacks courtesy of New York City staple Papaya King. "We all partied until 4 a.m. and closed the club down," Lana says. The couple then spent two weeks traveling in Greece and Croatia to celebrate their honeymoon. END

As her maid of honor you can count on being the bridal party's team captain, social director and at times, even their peacekeeper. END
BEGIN HERE Taking on this giant role is infamous for a few reasons. First, it can be extra time consuming — it's not uncommon for MOHs to feel as if it's somewhat of a part-time job, albeit a fun one. You're required to be there for your almost-married friend through everything from planning obstacles to emotional roller coasters, all the while maintaining the role as the voice of reason AND continuing to be her best friend. It's a tough balancing act but, in the end, totally worth it to stand next to your BFF on her big day. END

BEGIN HERE As the bride's right-hand women, you're in charge of throwing some large-scale pre-wedding events — the bachelorette party, the bridal shower, maybe even an engagement brunch — as well as picking up the tab for decorations and other miscellaneous items here and there before the wedding takes place. You'll also have to buy the bridesmaid dress the bride carefully picked out for you — plus alterations, shoes, jewelry, etc. — and then, carefully pick out a gift or two for her off the wedding registry.

BEGIN HERE When the big proposal happens, most brides hit the ground running and begin planning their wedding. However, sometimes it's best not to be in a rush to start the rest of your life. Here, real brides share why they had long engagements — and why pumping the brakes on planning actually turned out to be a good thing. END
BEGIN HERE "I had started planning our wedding for 2016 and then quickly pressed pause. Between friend and family drama I was getting really stressed out and the engagement was turning into a nightmare rather than an exciting time in my life. By stretching out the amount of time to plan, I'm able to take my time to think things over and diffuse tense situations." —Cristy END
BEGIN HERE "I got engaged in September of 2015 and I'm getting married on May 28th 2017. Why such a long engagement? My mom is generously paying for most of the wedding, but I know there are going to be things she doesn't think are necessities that I do — for example hair extensions, spray tans, regular facials leading up to the big day, accessories for my bridesmaids. So I want time to save my money and pay for these things myself. That way, I keep the peace and everything is smooth sailing." —Glori END
BEGIN HERE "I was unemployed when we got engaged and soon after began a new job. I'd been unemployed since the previous March due to layoffs, and when my fiancé proposed, it really helped me kick my job search into gear. I found a great full time job soon after, but I wanted to make sure I was giving myself enough time to adjust to the new position before diving into wedding planning." —Eve  END
BEGIN HERE "We fell in love and became engaged very quickly — in three months! Our families were afraid we were being too hasty, and it made sense to take our time and get to really know one another. Three years in, we're sure it's not infatuation and that we have what it take to last and we're finally planning the big day!" —Sari END
BEGIN HERE "I'd seen several friends who got engaged and married within a year settle for venues that weren't top of their list, as well as not be able to book the photographer of their dreams.

BEGIN HERE Moms get most of the attention when it comes to wedding day roles. Whether they're zipping their daughter into her dress or dancing with their son, they've got a lot to do! Even the father of the bride has a big role (walking his daughter down the aisle!). But what about the groom's dad? We asked our experts about the role of the father of the groom. END
BEGIN HERE The groom's parents often host the rehearsal dinner, which is the groom's father's opportunity to act as host for the evening, helping plan the event in honor of his son. END
BEGIN HERE If the groom and his father are close, he might want to invite his dad to join him as he and his groomsmen get ready the morning of the wedding, whether it's an early round of golf or hanging out and watching football as they put on their tuxedos. He'll be extra handy when it comes time to tie the groom's bowtie! END
BEGIN HERE At the ceremony, the groom's father's biggest role is to walk his wife, the groom's mother, down the aisle. If the groom's parents are divorced and the father is remarried, he should escort his new wife down the aisle and to her seat. END
BEGIN HERE If the bride and groom are having a receiving line, he should participate as well, standing alongside the bride's parents and welcoming guests. Even if the groom's family isn't contributing to the cost of the wedding, the groom's parents should act as co-hosts, welcoming everyone and making sure they're comfortable throughout the evening. END
BEGIN HERE At the reception, the father of the groom should be prepared with a toast if requested by the newlyweds. This toast usually takes place shortly after the father of the bride's toast. END
BEGIN HERE Once dancing starts, the father of the groom should make a point to dance with the bride, as well as the bride's mother. Throughout the evening, he should socialize with his guests as well as with his new in-laws — you're all family now! END

BEGIN HERE On a sunset walk along a lake near Austin, Texas, Trevor Dunlap issued a challenge to his longtime girlfriend Randi Reed: Prove you love me, he dared her. "No, you prove it," she replied. And he did, in immediate and spectacular fashion. There, he got down on one knee and popped the question, catching his future bride-to-be entirely off guard. END
BEGIN HERE The decision to host their April 25, 2015, wedding in Austin was an easy one. The city held special meaning for Randi and Trevor, who spent time there together while the groom earned his master's degree at University of Texas. Plus, with Trevor's family from Houston and Randi's family in Virginia, the location allowed the couple to host a destination wedding for all their guests — albeit a closer destination for some. END
BEGIN HERE Selecting the striking Roman-revival Central Christian Church for their ceremony and the Vineyards at Chappel Lodge for the reception helped guide the tone of their big day and a Texas-meets-Los-Angeles vibe quickly emerged. They wanted their nuptials to be a mix between laid-back country and chic city, and with the help of Liv By Design Events, they were able to strike that balance perfectly. And thanks to Ashley Garmon Photographers, we get the huge pleasure of enjoying their hard work now. END

"Once I tried something like that on, I realized it wasn't what I was looking for at all," she admits. With the help of her matron of honor, Randi narrowed her choices down to two classic options by Vera Wang. END
BEGIN HERE She ultimately chose a ball gown that featured a corseted lace bodice and a layered tulle skirt. To add a bit of bling to the look, Randi added a beaded Carolina Herrera belt to the waistline and slipped on Jimmy Choo shoes. She carried an all-white bouquet of peonies, ranunculus, garden and spray roses, and dahlias, with subtle hints of blush astilbe. END

"I fell in love with its ornate iron doors and the courtyard, and I was taken with the Romanesque revival interior with large green columns, wooden rafters and a magnificent soaring altar." With its stunning architecture, the couple decided the church needed little in the way of ceremony decor, opting to place eucalyptus and Italian ruscus runners along the altar and white blooms tied in blush-hued ribbons on the pews.

BEGIN HERE A family friend flew in from Virginia to officiate the ceremony. "His daughter was one of the friends that introduced Trevor and I," Randi explains, "and she's one of my closest friends and was a bridesmaid. A few weeks after meeting Trevor I told her I was going to marry him! It was special to have her dad be the person who married us ten years later." END
BEGIN HERE Since he knew the couple so well, their pastor was able to tailor the ceremony to fit Randi and Trevor's personalities. "His sermon was touching, funny, and brought a real air of intimacy into the church," says the bride. The couple further personalized this portion of their day by weaving in special readings performed by family members. END
BEGIN HERE A string quartet performed throughout the ceremony. "I love music, and it was one of the things I felt most strongly about for the ceremony and reception," Randi says. To get it right, the bride worked with her longtime piano instructor to choose specific songs for the ceremony that would work well with the quartets capabilities, including the couple's recessional song: "Come Fly With Me" by Frank Sinatra.

BEGIN HERE Randi and Trevor had initially struggled to find a reception venue that conveyed the Hill Country vibe the couple so desired. But when they saw the Vineyards at Chappel Lodge's fields, they knew it was the perfect spot. "The open spaces immediately transport you from downtown Austin into true Texas Hill Country with large oak trees and countless wildflowers," Randi says. But building a tent from scratch in the open field wasn't an easy undertaking. "Up until a month before the wedding we were still trying to find someone to custom build items for the tent." END
BEGIN HERE Despite the logistical headaches, the final product was well worth the effort. "The reception venue was extremely special," Randi says. "We were the first wedding to be held in their wildflower fields. Planning long-distance had me second-guessing myself a few times, but it was more beautiful than I could have imagined." END
BEGIN HERE She continues, "The large oak trees surrounding us for cocktail hour while a local bluegrass band played was idyllic, and seeing the tent in the middle of a huge field of bluebonnets really felt like the epitome of Texas. At the end of the night, before our exit, there was a moment when it was just Trevor, myself, my parents, and our wedding planners. We looked at the empty tent all set up exactly the way we had imagined and I couldn't believe it. I didn't want to leave." END
BEGIN HERE During the outdoor cocktail hour, guests sipped the couple's two signature drinks: The Pear Press, a mix of champagne, St. Germaine, and fresh pear juice, or the Crockett's Corona, raspberry juice, vodka, and Corona. Since Randi and Trevor wanted this to be an interactive portion of the evening, they served freshly-shucked oysters and made to order guacamole. END

Stem Floral created towering centerpieces of red, blush, and ivory blooms that were arranged in gold trumpet vases. The florist also added greenery garlands the back of the couple's chairs. END
BEGIN HERE One of the bride's favorite elements of the reception décor were their watercolor dinner napkins, which coordinated perfectly with their floral envelope liners, ceremony programs, and dessert bar display. "I can't be sure a single guest noticed, but I appreciated it," she says. END
BEGIN HERE Food was also hugely important to the couple, who insisted that everything served throughout the evening be sourced as locally as possible. "We put all the farm information on the dinner menus since everything came from somewhere in Texas," Randi says of their family-style meal. "We loved the idea of serving everything family-style because it promotes interaction and dialogue at the table. Also it's perfect for someone like me that is a more picky eater, or Trevor who is ready for a second helping before most have started." END

There's no need to create customized bags for each couple (though a personalized note is a great idea!), but what if some of your guests are traveling with children? Our experts weigh in on whether you should create separate kid-friendly welcome bags. END
BEGIN HERE The need to create kid-friendly welcome bags depends on what you'll be including inside the bag. If you're filling it with a selection of your favorite snacks, reusable water bottles, and a map of town, you could definitely get away with using the same bag for guests of all ages. But if you're including alcohol, such as a bottle of wine or a kit to make your favorite cocktail, you'll want to set aside a few bags and swap the booze out for drinks like fruit juice or soda. END
BEGIN HERE For a weekend-long event, you might want to put together a little something to keep the kids entertained. For a beach wedding, tuck in inflatable beach balls or a frisbee. Getting married in the city? A guide to the local natural history museum would be a great addition. END
BEGIN HERE You might want to swap out those fancier snacks for something a little more approachable, such as gummy candies or cheese crackers. Instead of leaving them in the branded bags, buy in bulk and package the treats in cellophane bags tied with ribbon for a dressed-up spin. END
BEGIN HERE You could also include kid-friendly activities, from playing cards and coloring books to I Spy games paired with instant cameras, to entertain the little ones during cocktail hour or once they've finished having dinner.

But, if you want to avoid guests bothering you with closet questions, you might want to consider paying more attention to what goes on that invitation. "Invitations are one of the first things guests formally receive about your wedding, so it's the perfect opportunity to set the stage for the look and feel of the celebration you're planning," says Caitlin Wechtaluk, owner and designer of Caitlin Creative Works invitations and event branding in Rockville, Md.

"Any reputable stationer can help guide you through the countless details that will honor your vision and the formality or informality of this important day." Take note of their tips: END
BEGIN HERE   It's not all just what's on the invitation itself that matters, sometimes it's all about the packaging. "Finishing touches such as a wax seal, personalized belly band, or calligraphy on inner or outer envelopes will often suggest a more formal affair," says Wechtaluk. In the same way, colorful envelopes, quirky envelope liners, and infographics on the details card may indicate a more casual night. END

If you're mature enough to be able to discuss the importance of a prenuptial agreement, and can hammer one out and still see romance ahead, you're ready to move in together." It's uncomfortable to discuss these details, of course. But, says Masini, "living together is full of all sorts of not so sexy events like losing a job, death of a parent, illness, accidents, difficult kids and step-kids, and if you can deal with the grown up and business side of relationships, you're definitely more ready to move in together than a couple who can't or doesn't want to deal with this."

BEGIN HERE Who else has been waiting, wishing, and hoping to catch a glimpse of Saint West since the latest Kimye baby was bestowed upon the world? After oohing and ahhing over how cute his big sister North West was as a tiny tot, we've been dying for a photo of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's sure-to-be-adorable bundle of joy. And today is finally the day that we come face to face with the newest member of the Kardashian-West clan! And guess what? He's even cuter than we had imagined. (But was there ever really any doubt about that?) END
BEGIN HERE Move over, North West! It's time for your baby brother to steal some of that spotlight. On Kim Kardashian's iPhone app and website this morning, the proud mama of two shared a photo of her 3-month-old son for the first time. "Today is my dad's birthday," she wrote. "I know there's nothing more in the world he would have wanted than to meet his grandchildren. So I wanted to share this pic of Saint with you all." END
BEGIN HERE Since giving birth to Saint on December 5, Kardashian and her hubby have been keeping those baby photos under lock and key, having only previously released an image of the newborn's teeny tiny fingers clasping his big sister's hand. But finally we're getting a peak at those totally adorbs chubby cheeks! END

BEGIN HERE In the super sweet snapshot, Saint West is seen sleeping peacefully, surrounded by white bedding and wearing a cream-colored onesie, his arms stretched out above his head. Forget a saint, this kid looks like an angel! From the looks of it, this little one is the spitting image of both of his parents and we can't stop cooing over his chubby cheeks and adorable little features. END

BEGIN HERE Mom-to-be Chrissy Teigen and hubby John Legend have been getting plenty of parenting practice before their baby girl is born this spring. Between raising their three adorable pups and swapping maternity secrets with Kim Kardashian and Kany West it seems like these two are totally prepared for the newest addition to their family. Just this past weekend, Teigen was able to practice a crucial part of being a parent — holding a baby. END
BEGIN HERE According to People, The Sports Illustrated model's mom, Vilailuck Teigen, posted a snap on instagram of her daughter cradling a precious little tot. "So cute! @chrissyteigen," the grandmother-to-be wrote. Teigen couldn't help but tweet about her baby-holding experience either writing, "I just held a tiny baby of sleepy mush and I'm just prepping you for 'chrissy teigen holds baby stupidly' article. She was nuzzly and happy!" Sorry Teigen, we couldn't help ourselves! END
BEGIN HERE That adorably baby wasn't the only person who got some snuggles from the model, her husband John Legend needed some cuddle action, too. After a whirlwind SI Swimsuit press tour, Teigen was reunited with her Grammy-winning husband. Grandmother-to-be posted side-by-side pictures of the singer kissing his expectant wife's belly and another of the two snuggled up on the couch. This grandma-to-be is totally nailing the cute, candid snap. She must be practicing her photography skills for when her granddaughter is born! END
BEGIN HERE Teigen and Legend have been documenting their pregnancy every step of the way. The mom-to-be recently revealed that she was doing IVF treatments during her Sports Illustrated shoot. "I was getting my shots and everything in Zanzibar, I had a little medical kit. It was hard because you bloat from it, and you bruise— if I hit the wrong area. That's the kind of things we had to cover with makeup," she explained. The model posted a few snaps from the shoot on her Instagram and even with the struggle of taking IVF shots on set; she looks as gorgeous as ever. We have a feeling the model's little girl is going to be as gorgeous as her mom! END

BEGIN HERE If there's one thing couples look forward to about wedding planning more than anything else, it's the wedding cake tasting. And how could you not? You get to spend an hour or two eating cake, combining cake and frosting flavors to create your perfect bite, and then make plans to eat cake yet again at your wedding. What's not to love? END
BEGIN HERE While the eating part of a cake tasting is pretty self-explanatory, there's a little more to it than just indulging your sweet tooth. We talked to Chef Katy Pierson, owner and designer of Sugar in Breckenridge, Colorado, about what really happens at a cake tasting. END
BEGIN HERE   Thankfully, you don't have to decide everything about your cake while you're in a sugar coma. "But the more you decide while you're there will keep you organized and check things off the list," says Pierson. "Picking flavors and a general design concept is a good place to start. You'll also be deciding whether or not this is the baker you want to hire, and if the answer is 'yes,' you'll be signing a contract and putting down a deposit to secure them for your date." END
BEGIN HERE It looks like this happy couple spared no expensive when it came to their big day! Former Laguna Beach and The Hills star, Casey Reinhardt, is officially off the market after tying the knot to her longtime love, Sean Brown, over the weekend. The reality TV star took to Instagram to share some of the most opulent details from her lavish California nuptials. END
BEGIN HERE It looks like the cast of this MTV reality show is hitting some major milestones! Between the recent Southern California nuptials of an all-grown-up, Taylor Cole, and the joyous pregnancy announcement from former cast member, Alex Murrel, it's safe to say that these legendary California ladies have put their reality show past behind them. END
BEGIN HERE Reinhardt, the self-titled "Cupcake Queen", is the latest to join the Laguna Beach married club after saying her "I dos" to husband, Sean Brown, during an extravagant Newport Beach wedding, Us Weekly reports. The gorgeous bride stunned in an opulent white lace gown, complemented by her effortless blonde curls and tiara-inspired headpiece. Reinhardt's new hubby, who shares family ties to the late Nicole Brown Simpson, also looked the part by donning a matching white tux and black slacks. END
BEGIN HERE The happy couple, who danced the night away under fireworks and to a performance by legendary crooner, Sara Bareilles, took to Instagram to share their most heartfelt wedding moments. "Last night was the most magical, incredible, most emotional night of my life!!!" wrote Reinhardt in her sentimental caption of a candid moment between the two newlyweds. "I became Mrs. Casey Beau Brown and I get to spend the rest of my life with the most amazing man who ever walked this earth. I'm so happy, so in love, and so overwhelmed with emotion just thinking about how beautiful the rest of our lives are going to be together. You are my angel on earth @seanmbrown1 and I'm the luckiest girl in the world to be your wife!!!" END
BEGIN HERE The newly crowned Mrs. Brown also shared a touching moment of her and her new hubby standing underneath their stunning altar, followed by a blissful snapshot of the couple rejoicing after saying their "I dos." END
BEGIN HERE The reality TV duo first announced their engagement late last year, confirming the news with a close up photo of the bride-to-be's ginormous sparkler. The blonde beauty showed off the gorgeous pear-shaped engagement ring on Instagram, followed by a photo of the bended knee moment with the caption, "My breath is taken away...I've never felt happier in my entire life!!! I love you so much @seanmbrown1!!!! How lucky am I to have found my soulmate...I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you!!!!!!!! Happiest day of my life!! I feel so blessed!!!!" END
BEGIN HERE If you've ever seen the movie 27 Dresses, you know the potential fashion torture of being a bridesmaid. For the most part, you have zero control over what you wear and are at the mercy of the bride and her personal style preferences, which may or may not be on point. Now, while you can't exactly turn down wearing a hideous gown (unless you don't mind ruining your friendship and getting kicked out of the wedding), you can post this piece on your Facebook page so the world, okay...the bride, knows you're not down with these 5 styles. Um...hint, hint! END
BEGIN HERE   We're talking hideous 80's looking prom dresses and gowns with conflicting patterns.

BEGIN HERE Are #EngagementPartyGoals a thing? Because this bash would definitely qualify. On Saturday night, the over-the-moon couple put on their dancing shoes (were they ever off, though?) and headed to Manhattan's Diamond Horseshoe club to show off Murgatroyd's engagement bling. And according to E! News, the place was packed with DWTS pros and celeb alums. END
BEGIN HERE Chmerkovskiy and Murgatroyd chose a masquerade theme for their engagement bash and provided ornate masks for their attending friends and family. Their wedding cake was also on theme, featuring three intricately-designed tiers, feathers, and a masquerade mask. As for her bride-to-be ensemble, Murgatroyd went with satin tuxedo-style dress that flowed out into a uber-trendy high-low skirt. She paired the look with white lace pants for a totally modern look.

Willis even honored the couple with a solo performance of Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You" at the end of the night! END

BEGIN HERE You've made it through the wedding ceremony and cocktail hour, managed to eat during dinner (hopefully!), and now it's time for the first dance. Whether you've spent months practicing a choreographed routine or are opting for the classic High School Sway, this moment in the spotlight can be nerve-wrecking. The thought of missing a step, while not enough to throw off your entire day, can still be stressful. What can you do if your first dance isn't going as planned? Here's what our experts say you should do to get your groove back. END
BEGIN HERE Even hours of rehearsal can't prepare you for all the things you'll be feeling during your first dance: Love, excitement, nerves, relief. And once that music starts, it can feel like there's no going back. So what if you and your fiancé mess up your choreography, can you start over? If you're only a few bars into the song, go for it. Let your musicians or DJ know to try it again from the top, smile (and laugh if you can!), take a deep breath, and get back into position. If you're more than halfway through the song, try your best to recover gracefully. Count the beats to get back on track, or trade in your fancy footwork for a simple sway or twirl. Chances are your guests will be too busy wiping happy tears out of their eyes to even notice! And anyone who has ever been on stage will tell you, the show must go on! END
BEGIN HERE What if that misstep comes in the form of an interruption? The same rules apply. If you've just started the song, try it again from the top. If you're further along, just roll with it. You might consider beckoning to your wedding party to take the dance floor with you, transitioning from a moment in the spotlight to the beginning of a dance party with the people you love. And luckily, the most common type of first dance interruption is impossibly cute: A flower girl or ring bearer who wants to join in on the fun. Embrace the sweet photo opp, and finish out the song as a trio — and be sure to save the pictures for their own wedding in 20 or so years! END
BEGIN HERE As Chelsea Harms and Evan Tuohy lounged on a sandy beach outside their home in Puerto Rico, Evan asked Chelsea what she wanted for Christmas. She ticked off a number items before Evan casually asked if she might like an engagement ring — and held up a sparkling band. "I was so surprised," Chelsea says. "It was the perfect moment. We brought out champagne and watched a sailboat pass in front of the sun." END
BEGIN HERE The couple decided on a reverse-destination wedding for their April 18, 2015 nuptials. Instead of bringing guests to the Caribbean for their wedding, Chelsea and Evan traveled from their home in Puerto Rico, where they both work as marine biologists, to Winona, Texas, where the bride's sister-in-law's family owns and operates a sprawling ranch, for a natural celebration surrounded by 90 guests. The couple envisioned a rustic, vintage fête, and their family helped them accomplish their dream from afar. "Thanks to the efforts of my brother, sister-in-law and her family, we were able to have our dream wedding," Chelsea says. And lucky for them, Feather & Twine Photography was there to document it all.  END

The ethereal gown was beautiful, but not the sexy sheath she had envisioned. "Once I put this one on, it was like stepping into something made just for me and my personality," Chelsea says. "I decided to go with what made me feel like me, rather than what I thought would be pretty on me." To add to the heavenly look, Chelsea donned a green and white floral crown. END

"I wanted them to be comfortable and find something they felt good in, but also it fit our theme of that mixed match look," the bride says. One thing she asked all of her 'maids to match? Their shoes. "They wore the same rose gold sandals because they are all taller than me," Chelsea says. END

"Starting in December, Evan, my brother, my dad, and I worked to build three tables for family dinner seating, a sweetheart table for Evan and I, and a cake table," Chelsea says. "This required the most time and effort and wasn't finished until about four days before the wedding." END

Her advice to future brides is to have a back-up plan. "Most importantly, be prepared to make final decisions and be happy with those choices," she says. "Everyone is there to see you, so it doesn't matter if they are watching from under umbrellas, or sitting in a barn instead of outdoors. Let the little things be little things." END

BEGIN HERE For the logistically-minded bride, nothing beats a big city when it comes to wedding locations. There's an abundance of hotel options, built-in entertainment for your guests in the days surrounding your wedding, and just about any type of venue you could imagine. Whether you want to party with 300 people in the poshest of ballrooms or cozy up with 15 friends in the private dining room of your favorite restaurant, you can make it happen. But, even with all that convenience comes a few downfalls. We spoke to Teissia Treynet, founder of Firefly Events in New York City, to sort through some of the details every city bride should be sure to keep in mind. END
BEGIN HERE   Before you book, find out if your venue or the surrounding buildings will be under construction during the time of your wedding. "Not only is the noise awful, there's nothing worse than scaffolding in the background of your wedding pictures or towering in front of your gorgeous venue," Treynet explains. END
BEGIN HERE Now this is something to sing about. Former Glee star Dianna Agron is reportedly engaged to Mumford & Sons banjoist Winston Marshall. And her yellow gold engagement ring is totally fitting of Quinn Fabray — er, we mean Dianna Agron. END
BEGIN HERE After being spotted walking hand-in-hand in Paris this past July, the musical pair declared themselves officially an item and now Us Weekly is confirming that Marshall has popped the question to the Glee beauty. Although the to-be-wed twosome are currently remaining mum on the engagement details, the proposal supposedly occurred over the holidays, putting them in good company with celeb couples like Pitch Perfect co-stars Anna Camp and Skylar Astin and Ryan Phillippe and Paulina Slagter, who also got engaged this winter. END
BEGIN HERE Instead of debuting her engagement ring on the red carpet, Agron chose an even better avenue — the runway.

Heather Morris and hubby Taylor Hubble threw themselves a wedding (and basically a Glee reunion!) last May. And Melissa Benoist found love on set with costar Blake Jenner. END
BEGIN HERE If your dream proposal includes being dressed to perfection in a floor length sparkly gown, a stunning Neil Lane diamond ring on your finger, and a professional film crew there to catch every moment of the proposal, you're probably not the only one. In fact, over the last 20 seasons of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette many proposals have taken place this way. For countless viewers, this is their dream proposal. But for bride-to-be and former Bachelorette Kaitlyn Bristowe however, not so much. END
BEGIN HERE "We used the show to meet each other and find each other, but we really started dating after the show," Bristowe, who got engaged to Shawn Booth last summer, said. The bride-to-be revealed to Us Weekly that Booth is actually planning a second proposal — away from the spotlight. END
BEGIN HERE "When I pictured a guy proposing to me, I don't picture knowing it's coming and cameras," Bristow said. "I want to be surprised— I'm not going to say how I want it because I don't know. But just being surprised and having that emotion, like, 'Oh, my God!'" Bristowe has always played by her own rules so it's no shock she's shaking things up with a second proposal. END
BEGIN HERE "We only knew each other for ten weeks before I proposed," Booth points out. "We're both normal people and the most normal thing we can do is wait." Okay Booth does make a good point, but that doesn't mean we aren't still anxiously awaiting their walk down the aisle. END
BEGIN HERE The pair has been taking things slow since the show ended (well as slow as you can take your relationship when it starts with an engagement ring), only recently deciding to move-in together. They've even created their own celebrity couple name. "We call ourselves the Boothstowes," the former Bachelorette explained to People. "But when I get married, I'm going to take his name. I'm not a traditional person, but when it comes to that, I like the idea of being traditional. I think it's romantic." END

BEGIN HERE Whether or not to include children on your wedding guest list is a personal decision that has to be made by each couple individually. Many couples love to have the little ones involved, and look forward to the pictures of chaos on the dance floor when the flower girls get twirling. But for some brides and grooms, it's purely a matter of dollars and cents, and the size of their families makes it impossible for them to include all the generations. END
BEGIN HERE There are also couples that just don't want to have any small children at their wedding. Some brides and grooms don't want to share the spotlight, and they shouldn't have to do so. It's their wedding and it can be adults-only if they want to keep it that way. After all, there are no rules about whether or not you have to invite children to a wedding. But, regardless of this fact, the issue of kids can be a high-drama matter for some couples, especially if there are family members whose feelings mist be hurt by the lack of inclusion of children. My professional advice? It's best to share that information as early as possible in the planning process &so way everyone who needs to make childcare arrangements can take care of it well in advance. END
BEGIN HERE But some couples simply must invite kids, whether they want to or not. So what should you do if you really don't want to have children at your wedding, but it would be a political family disaster if you threw down the gauntlet and left all the kids off the list? Easy. Just implement these three easy tricks to lessen (not exclude) the presence of children. END
BEGIN HERE   Tell the photographer and videographer that you're not interested in footage of the little ones trying to learn the "Wobble." Let the DJ know that you don't want any kiddo-focused music.

After ringing in Valentine's Day with her new fiancé, and a brand new sparkler, this Australian actress is finally sharing a close up view of her latest accessory. "I walked into our lounge Friday evening and he was on his knee with a beautiful box in his hands," Whelan told People of her unexpected proposal. "I saw the sparkle coming out of the box, so pure and perfect and simple. And very unexpected." The bride-to-be took to Instagram to share the celebratory news by posting an adorable snapshot of her and her NFL beau. The photo shows the newly engaged twosome beaming, while the Australian beauty candidly holds up her newly decked out ring finger. The future Mrs. Rhodes captioned the touching photo with a simple, "He's the one...#engaged." END

Whelan's football player beau got some help from New York City jewelry designer, Gabriel Jacobs, of Rafaello and Co. Jewelers, in an effort to help him find the perfect proposal diamond. The jewelry company posted a congratulatory message in honor of the doting couple's engagement, sharing a close up of the 6.5-carat radiant-cut canary diamond.

BEGIN HERE Your wedding will be the most photographed day of your life, so you'll want to look your best. Hair and makeup artists are the secret to getting camera-ready while still being able to relax as you get prepared for your big day. As for everyone else in your wedding party, they'll want to look their best, too. But who, exactly should you be booking appointments for? Here's who our experts think should get the glam squad treatment. END
BEGIN HERE Whether you're offering hair and makeup appointments as a gift, or are asking your girls to make their own appointments for your wedding day, be sure to start off by finding out who is actually interested in the services. Some people have very sensitive skin, don't wear makeup, or don't like having their makeup done, and others might prefer to do their hair on their own, so be sure to confirm that everyone will be comfortable (and excited!) before you book anything. You could also offer just hair styling, just makeup application, or invite them to come and hang out even if they'll be dolling themselves up. END
BEGIN HERE As far as who you should be extending the invite to, offer hair and makeup to any women who will be walking down the aisle, as well as any female immediate family members. This means your mother, your mother-in-law, your bridesmaids, and both your and your fiancé's sisters should be on the schedule. If you have a flower girl, ask her mom whether she'd like to take care of her daughter's hair, or if she thinks a quick pass of the curling iron by the hair stylist could be helpful. END
BEGIN HERE  A Breakdown of the Perfect Getting-Ready Timeline END
BEGIN HERE Offering hair and makeup services to your grandmothers is a sweet gesture, but isn't required. And you don't need to offer any services to your ceremony readers (unless they're part of the wedding party, of course!). If you have guests coming in from out of town, and your wedding is going to be more formal, consider providing the names of a few local salons you love for any guests who might want to spend the morning the same way you will be: being pampered in anticipation of a fabulous celebration! END
BEGIN HERE First things first, if you're engaged just know that you're probably guilty of at least one, if not more, of these, which is completely fine. We know it's hard not to be a little bit obnoxious when you've got that head over heels, "can't-eat, can't-sleep, reach-for-the-stars, over-the-fence, World Series" kind of thing going on, right? With that said though, you can rest assured you're not alone if these eight things other lovey-dovey engaged couples do that secretly (or not so secretly) annoy the crap out of you. END
BEGIN HERE   That you just have to share on social media to let the world know firsthand how freaking cute/awesome/amazing your fiancé is. Barf! END
BEGIN HERE You've spent months planning your wedding and building up the internal anticipation to take those memorable steps down the aisle. But, even if all the items on your to-do list are sitting there with a check mark, there's still one more thing you'll need to do to make it "official" — get your marriage license. If you're wondering how to do it — and do it right — here are six things to know before heading to get the license that makes you and your fiancé a married couple. END

BEGIN HERE Thought your seaside wedding was unique? Well, these adventurous newlyweds have you beat! Crystal and Justin Reynolds' recent walk down the aisle was more like a swim, as they exchanged vows underwater at the Georgia Aquarium over the weekend. Who needs a bridal party when you've got manta rays, whale sharks, and dozens of fish by your side? END
BEGIN HERE Their love story began on the online dating site Plenty of Fish and their wedding included, well, plenty of fish! As avid divers, Crystal and Justin wanted to find a way to incorporate their love of the ocean into their nuptials. But a coastal ceremony or beachy reception just wasn't daring enough for these two. Instead, they opted to tie the knot as the world's largest species of shark swam by to wish them best wishes. Talk about taking the plunge! END
BEGIN HERE After serving as the venue for countless weddings, this was Georgia Aquarium's first underwater ceremony, taking place in their 6.3 million-gallon tank. "We never thought we would get married in an aquarium, but it mixes our love for diving and for one another. It's something we love doing together," Crystal explained on the aquarium's blog. END
BEGIN HERE On the big day, the bride donned a traditional white lace wedding dress (over her wetsuit, of course) and the pair floated down to the bottom of the tank to exchange their sea-centric vows. "I don't need to mull it over — we are manta be together," and "I conch wait to make it a fish shell," were among the couple's pun-soaked promises! The aquarium's expert dive team remained nearby just in case a whale shark decided to object. END

BEGIN HERE R&B artist NE-YO and his fiancé Crystal Renay officially tied the knot Saturday night, and all through the wedding celebration and festivities this celebrity couple has been sharing all the details, most recently giving a glimpse into post-nuptial bliss as husband and wife. END
BEGIN HERE Renay posted a video to Instagram of her new husband carrying her over the threshold after the wedding. "When you're 9 months pregnant and your husband.. Wait let me say that again HUSBAND is still a gentleman and carries your fat butt," Has NE-YO officially become the best new husband ever? After carrying his blushing bride into their house, the two share a quick sweet kiss. END
BEGIN HERE NE-YO looks worry free carrying the mother-to-be, but the R&B singer wasn't as carefree on their wedding day. "I'm more concerned about her making it all the way down the aisle or if her water breaks or something," he told People. NE-YO wasn't the only one worried about his bride's rapidly approaching due date, Renay had a few concerns too. "I'm gonna be honest: I'm nine months pregnant— I'm nervous about falling on my face!" the bride told People prior to their nuptials. Luckily she made it down the aisle without even stumbling. And while her water breaking definitely would've made the day more eventful, the California nuptials went off without a hitch. END
BEGIN HERE The two said "I Do" in a romantic sunset ceremony overlooking the Pacific Ocean at the Terranea Resort. "They stood under a big wooden altar that was draped with white curtains and flowers," an insider told Us Weekly. "At the end of the ceremony, NE-YO and Crystal held hands and raised their arms into the air as all the guests screamed and cheered. They looked so happy and in love." END
BEGIN HERE Renay looked stunning in her wedding dress, which featured illusion sleeves with lace embroidery. Her dress was gorgeous and accommodated her growing belly — win win! "When I went to my first fitting, I had actually just found out the day before that I was pregnant," Renay explained to People. "So from the beginning of the whole dress process, we knew that it would be a growing belly." END
BEGIN HERE Now that these two newlyweds have their wedding in the past, it's time to start the countdown to their new baby. We have a feeling NE-YO will be putting on R&B spin on all the classic lullabies — he is a Grammy-winning artists after all. END
BEGIN HERE Whether you're planning your wedding in eight months or 18, you'll hit a point where you just want a little break from the linen colors, table assignments, and tastings (okay... maybe not the tastings). Don't let the to-do lists stop you from focusing on the reason you're having a wedding: to start your marriage! You may want to keep the romance alive, take a chance to get up and stretch your legs, or just forget about the details for a little while and have some fun. No matter how much time you've got, here are some of our favorite ideas for a wedding planning break. END
BEGIN HERE   Early on in the planning process? Now's the time to schedule a weekly date with no wedding talk allowed. Whether Taco Tuesday becomes your planning-free-zone, you meet up for lunch on Thursdays, or Saturday brunch is totally off-limits, scheduling a time where you intentionally don't talk about the wedding will give you a few hours to focus on each other. END
BEGIN HERE By now we all know that walking down the aisle should feel just like walking down the red carpet. It's your moment to shine, all eyes are on you, and the paparazzi (aka your guests) are all clamoring for the best photo! And of course, picking the right dress is of the utmost importance for both occasions. END

BEGIN HERE   It's no secret we love the Tatums around here, and of course we love seeing Jenna Dewan-Tatum on the red carpet. For last year's Oscars she went full on bridal — a very sexy bride at that — in a plunging Zuhair Murad column gown. 2016 brides take note, this is how you do modern bridal right. END
BEGIN HERE Let's start with the basics: The peak time for travel to the Caribbean is, generally speaking, December into April/May. While the region's rainy season technically begins in May, its full impact isn't usually felt until later in the summer, as the heat and humidity rises. (August through October, the heart of hurricane season, see the least visitors.)  END
BEGIN HERE There are a few golden months in between, however — May, June and July are often the "shoulder season" or "summer season" — when airfares and room rates begin to drop, coveted resorts are more likely to have availability and the crowds at popular beaches begin to wane (all the better for the requisite strolling on the beach photo ops). END
BEGIN HERE "We see that more guests come, due to the lower guest room rates," says Debbie Hutchinson, destination weddings sales manager at the Westin Grand Cayman Seven Mile Beach Resort & Spa. (Fact: Seven Mile Beach regularly ranks among top beaches in the Caribbean.) Other perks: The bride will have more venue options to choose from for the reception and there is more flexibility for concessions, Hutchinson says, like upgrades and better deals on suites because there is a better chance the resort has the ability to reserve it. END
BEGIN HERE "It's just an easier time to travel. No one's worrying about weather delays and everyone generally has more time off," says Erin Procter, wedding coordinator at The Buccaneer on St. Croix, an elegantly-appointed resort with a rich Caribbean history. END
BEGIN HERE And then there's the weather: warm, sunny, with gentle Caribbean breezes. While rain could disrupt a summer wedding in the States, not on St. Croix, says Procter, "If we do get rain, it rains for three minutes and then the sun's back out." END
BEGIN HERE So while the cost of wedding packages in the Caribbean generally remain the same throughout the year, a shoulder-season wedding comes with plenty of budget-stretching benefits, all of which is good news for brides-to-be. END
BEGIN HERE Once all the wedding gifts have been unwrapped and you're surrounded by new kitchen gadgets and fluffy bath towels from your wedding registry, penning upwards of 50 or more thank-you notes can be a little overwhelming. Sending a generic "thanks" based off of a template card may feel like the way to go if you want to save time and brainpower, but taking a few moments to send a unique note is a great way to practice gratitude and also properly thank your generous guests. Here's how to do it. END
BEGIN HERE NYC based wedding planner with Cloud Nove Events Regina Cialone says that proper etiquette dictates that the couple hand write the notes. Anything pre-printed might come across as "cold and impersonal," according to Cialone. Try to make what you write specific to each guest. "Dear Kelly and John, Thank you so much for joining us on our wedding day. It meant a lot to have you there, and we will forever have John's version of the 'Electric Slide' ingrained in our memories!" is a good example. "Even just a line or two of writing makes a difference," Cialone says. END
BEGIN HERE The best way to tackle this seemingly never-ending task? Write the notes as you receive the gifts before and after the wedding. "Every Sunday, sit down with a cup of coffee and write out the thank-you notes for those items," says Alex Chalk of Taylor'd Events Group. But do a little planning first. Make a spreadsheet listing the invitee, the gift given, and then a third column to keep some helpful notes. Jot down whether you've used the item yet, what you like about it, or how you plan to enjoy it. For example, do you look forward to making weekend brunch with your new waffle iron? This kind of specificity will make the notes a little more personal and less generic, says Kristen Ley Green of Something New for I Do. "You can even do this with cash or gift cards," Green says. Let the gift-giver know what you plan to purchase or how you'll make use of their generosity. END
BEGIN HERE If you receive a contribution to your honeymoon as a wedding gift, Cialone suggests including a photo with the card to show how you enjoyed your post-nuptial getaway. And if you're looking for an even more unique visual element, consider cards like Lovepop and Popwish (with whimsical 3D paper sculptures inside) or Popcards (video message cards that can include either footage from the big day or a grateful greeting from you and your hubby). END
BEGIN HERE Once you've picked out and penned the cards that best represent you as a couple, simply stamp the envelopes with your brand new monogram (if you decide to change your last name) like the Wilkins Stamp from Three Designing Women and drop them in the mailbox as soon as the ink dries. Then get back to enjoying life as newlyweds. END
BEGIN HERE Four years after meeting as summer associates at a law firm in 2008, Manoj brought Aileen to one of her favorite places in New York City: The New York Public Library. They'd planned to go on a hike the day before, but Aileen had gotten stuck at work, so thankfully the black-tie benefit they were heading to that evening at the Museum of Modern Art gave the pair an excuse to get dressed to the nines — and grab dinner at McDonald's. "It's what we always do when we're dressed up!" Aileen laughs. After finishing their dinner in front of the library, Manoj asked Aileen to take a picture of him on the steps. When she stepped back to ready the camera, he got down on one knee and held up a piece of paper that read "Will You Marry Me?". "He was so nervous, the sign was upside down! Lucky for him, I could still read it," Aileen remembers. END
BEGIN HERE The pair spent 18 months planning a wedding in two boroughs, with a Hindu ceremony at the Ganesh Temple in Flushing, Queens followed by a Christian ceremony and an evening reception at the Wythe Hotel in Brooklyn. On May 25, 2014, Daughter of Design and Amy Merrick Flowers & Styling transformed the hotel with a stunning overhead display of cherry blossoms and votive candles that had a magical effect on the space. Get a peek at this elegant, wild, and ever-so-slightly industrial garden party for 112 guests in the heart of Brooklyn, photographed by Belathée Photography. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Belathée Photography    END
BEGIN HERE After the morning's Hindu ceremony in Queens, Aileen added a dose of modern elegance with a chic updo, bold red lips, and swirling gold Christian Louboutin pumps beneath a soft Vera Wang ball gown. "When I tried this gown on for the first time, my father, who never had any interest in fashion, or ever got emotional over such things, said this was the dress he saw me getting married in. My favorite detail was the row of buttons down the back of the lace bodice," says Aileen. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Belathée Photography    END
BEGIN HERE Manoj set the reputation for choosing great formalwear during the proposal, and lived up to the hype on his wedding day when he donned a custom blue tuxedo. He completed his look with a boutonniere of jasmine and a white garden rose. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Belathée Photography    END
BEGIN HERE Aileen's bouquet had an overgrown, wild feel, combining peonies, garden roses, poppies, and anemones in shades of blush and ivory. Instead of carrying traditional nosegays, her bridesmaids wore blush peony corsages. END

BEGIN HERE The groomsmen wore suits in charcoal and dark blue, all with brown shoes. Even the couple's dog got in on the fun, wearing a soft blue floral print tie. END

BEGIN HERE      Photo: Belathée Photography    END
BEGIN HERE The flower girls wore ivory dresses and crowns of jasmine and garden roses. "Led by the ring bearer, the flower girls were supposed to enter the ceremony, then turn right to walk down the aisle. Instead, they missed their turn and kept walking! They almost passed the entire crowd before someone guided them in the direction of the aisle," Aileen laughs. END
BEGIN HERE Before sending out their invitations, the bride and groom gave guests a hint of what was in store with a custom Viewmaster save-the-date. For the invitations and ceremony programs, Julie Song Ink created a blush watercolor floral pattern, which was combined with modern calligraphy. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Belathée Photography    END
BEGIN HERE The industrial space, with exposed brick walls and wooden planks on the ceiling, was the perfect complement for the soft florals that Aileen envisioned. For the ceremony, the couple chose two dramatic arrangements of garden roses, foxglove, and cherry blossoms were surrounded by pillar candles. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Belathée Photography    END
BEGIN HERE "Because we were already having the morning ceremony at a separate location, we wanted to keep the evening ceremony and reception in the same venue instead of shuttling guests to yet a third place. We fell in love with the ambiance of the Wythe Hotel, and it was the perfect place to have our evening celebration all in one," says Aileen. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Belathée Photography    END
BEGIN HERE Julie Song Ink also created the blush escort cards with gray calligraphy. The Wythe's patio, complete with exposed beams and strings of café lights, turned out to be the perfect place for the party to enjoy cocktails while the venue was switched over for dinner. Guests sipped Dark and Stormy's and Old Fashioneds while eating jalapeno johnny cakes with cured ham and aged cheddar and grilled chicken skewers with spiced yogurt. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Belathée Photography    END
BEGIN HERE Inside the hotel, rows of chairs were replaced with long tables covered in ivory linens, low arrangements of peonies in blush and burgundy, and tall taper candles. The centerpieces were kept simple in order to have the focus remain on the cherry blossoms hanging from above. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Belathée Photography    END
BEGIN HERE Dinner was served family-style and included artichokes with chèvre and black currants, baby leek panzanella, pork loin with smashed Yukon potatoes, collard greens with ramp and bacon vinaigrette, and chicken with red rice and cumin. "We loved how the chefs were able to incorporate Indian and Chinese elements into the menu," says Aileen. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Belathée Photography    END
BEGIN HERE For dessert, the newlyweds cut into a naked Momofuku Milk Bar wedding cake, with layers of cake with rainbow sprinkles, vanilla frosting, and cake crumble. As dancing got underway, Aileen changed into a more fitted dress with an embroidered cape. END
BEGIN HERE A few days after the wedding, the couple took a trip of a lifetime, heading on a Serengeti safari in Tanzania, spending time on the beach in Zanzibar, and then taking on the city in Istanbul. "As we started planning, we had no idea what we wanted. But we were able to pare things down to what best represents both of us," says Aileen. "It's impossible to please everyone, so focus on the things that are true to the two of you." END

BEGIN HERE   Your bridesmaids are the group of people who will support you through thick and thin, through stressful moments and over-the-top fun during the entire wedding adventure. So when it comes time to picking out dresses for them, you want to make sure the dresses are something that fit your style but also will get them feeling excited and energized to stand beside you on your wedding day. END
BEGIN HERE There are so many dress options, styles, and colors to choose from. But before you go overboard with finding the perfect dress for your best friends, it's important to take a step back and determine what the price range of the dresses should be. Since the bridesmaids are usually the ones paying for the dresses, the best thing you can do is poll each of them to see what their dress budget is. END
BEGIN HERE  Affordable (and Stylish!) Bridesmaid Dresses Under $100 END
BEGIN HERE If you don't want to talk money with them, try and be considerate when picking dresses. Know that there are a lot of expenses that come with being a bridesmaid and if you can save them money off the price of the dress, they will really be appreciative. Try to keep the price of the dresses under $200 each. If it's over $200, perhaps consider paying the difference for them, especially if it's a dress style that you really love and want them to wear the most. END
BEGIN HERE If price is something you're worried about, you can go with the laid-back option of picking a color and having the bridesmaids pick the dress out themselves. That way, each bridesmaid can select a dress that compliments not only their style, but their budget as well. END
BEGIN HERE While anything goes when it comes to planning a wedding, some things you might hear simply aren't true. And we've got five brides ready to separate the lies from the truth. They're revealing the real things people told them before they tied the knot that turned out to be absolutely, positively false. END
BEGIN HERE "Everyone tells you that details matter, but they don't. Guests don't care one bit about the details. Looking back on a friend's wedding, I can't tell you what the bride's colors were, what the centerpieces looked like, or the intricate way she tied each and every ribbon onto the soap bar favors she sent us home with. Details help to add charm and character — but at the end of the day, your guests care that you had a good time, they had a good time, that everyone ate and drank well, and that the event as a whole was filled with joy and laughter." —Jessica END
BEGIN HERE "Several women have made me feel like my dress needed to be expensive or come from a fancy bridal boutique. But I had a friend who bought her dress used from a consignment shop for $150 — and she looked dynamite. I found a dress online that matches my personality to a 'T,' and someone in town is making it for me for less that $400." —Elizabeth END
BEGIN HERE "We were told that we can't leave anyone off of the guest list, or if someone invited us to our wedding, we have to invite them. But weddings are expensive and you should be sharing that day — and ultimately the price tag — with the people that you sincerely want there. Just because you work with them — or that certain gal pal or cousin invited you to her wedding — doesn't mean that you need to return the favor. Surround yourself with the people who truly matter to you." —Kara END
BEGIN HERE "Everywhere I looked on the Internet or in wedding magazines, I saw the same outline: Planning a wedding takes 18 months. Not at all! We planned ours in six months. Our wedding is two months away and nearly everything is ready to go! All we have to do is show up." —Amy END
BEGIN HERE "I had a friend tell me that DJ's aren't necessary anymore — you can just make a playlist. But sorry, that's not true. If you're having a large event or are truly wanting to end the night with a dance party, you need to pay for a professional. Plus, more than being just a music man, a DJ is often your master of ceremonies." —Jill END

BEGIN HERE He seemed fairly impressed that I knew exactly what I (errr, Rachel) wanted and that I had perused his Instagram to find inspiration. My basic requirements were as such: Cushion halo surrounding my grandmother's center stone, and diamonds about halfway down the band, which should be platinum or white gold. END
BEGIN HERE He pulled a number of rings and settings, which resulted in Ellen and I gawking in silence for for several minutes. I found my voice and courage, beginning my next line of questioning to narrow it down. END
BEGIN HERE "Not a cathedral setting." END
BEGIN HERE "Single shank." END
BEGIN HERE "A band needs to fits under it." END
BEGIN HERE "Cushion halo isn't too square." END
BEGIN HERE We got it down to two different settings and it seemed like it was time to talk about price, so Ellen asked if she should leave the room. I really didn't care either way, but she said she would and, in retrospect, that was probably a good call. The one I was leaning toward was more expensive, because of course. But since I wasn't buying a diamond and the price differences on settings weren't too far off, I figured I might as well pull out all the stops and make the setting look as beautiful as possible. END
BEGIN HERE He explained the drilling for stones on the band (which is still over my head), and I opted for pavé. We had a long discussion about platinum or 18K white gold and I ultimately made him convince me that platinum is a better investment. Clearly I can't make executive decisions. END
BEGIN HERE We came to a conclusion on price and since Ellen and Rachel wear the same size ring, I texted her to come back in so that I could confirm. The last choice was whether or not to get stones underneath the raised setting — at no extra cost. I wavered as per usual, Ellen wouldn't push me one way or the other (come on!) and I ultimately said yes. END
BEGIN HERE The whole process should take four weeks, the jeweler said. After a deep breath, I swiped my credit card for the deposit and just like that, I was officially on the verge of getting engaged. END
BEGIN HERE Out of the corner of my eye, I kept seeing Ellen with a huge smile on her face, looking like she was about to cry. When we got in the elevator to leave, we shared a huge hug. END
BEGIN HERE At Ellen's behest, I sent a photo of the setting to my mom, which resulted in a series of text messages with inordinate amounts of exclamation points. My two best friends also got the picture, earning me "holy (expletive) dude, you're actually getting engaged" responses. END

We are definitely sensing a pattern! END
BEGIN HERE The mom-to-be also touched on her nearly two-year-old son, Oliver's, feelings towards becoming a big brother. "He sometimes points to his own belly and asks if there's a baby in there," said the expectant mom about her firstborn's confusing concept of pregnancy. The mom-to-be hilariously responded with, "I say, 'Boys get other things and girls get the babies." Could they be any more adorable? END
BEGIN HERE But when it comes to baby names, this costar couple is already hitting a few speed bumps! The Once Upon a Time star told E! News that, "We go back and forth between different things," when it comes to discussing a name for their second bundle of joy. "It's hard because we feel like Oliver is the perfect name. You have to find something that's good with Oliver or Ollie." END

But what about what to do once you're actually in the bridal salon? Our experts have a few pieces of dress-shopping etiquette that every bride should be sure to remember. END
BEGIN HERE   Dress-shopping TV shows make it seem like a bride has unlimited time to browse the racks and try on dozens of dresses before choosing The One, but in reality, appointments are usually only an hour long. While you may be able to go slightly over on time (especially if you're this close to deciding which gown to purchase or are just about ready to be measured), keep in mind that there are other brides in the waiting room, and a schedule that the salon needs to stick to. If you think you need more time to mull it over, make a second appointment and come back to try on your top three choices with fresh eyes. END
BEGIN HERE Kimberly Pesch, the creative behind the popular fashion blog Eat.Sleep.Wear, first met Blake Lapides through work, but the pair didn't really start talking until they bumped into each other at the wedding of mutual friends in Philadelphia in 2012. A few months later, Kim invited Blake, who was living in San Diego, to join her in New York City for New Years Eve. "I didn't expect him to say yes at all," she says. But he did, and the pair spent the next months happily flying back and forth across the country to be together until Kim decided to make the move from the Big Apple out to the Golden state to be with her guy. END
BEGIN HERE Nine months later, after a long day of traveling, Kim crashed on the couple's couch ready for a relaxing evening in when Blake asked if she wanted to share a cupcake for dessert. "I nearly turned him down since I was so exhausted," she says. Thankfully, she didn't! Inside the box she found two incredibly sweet treats: a salted caramel cupcake and a ring box with a diamond sparkler. "Of course, I said yes!" END
BEGIN HERE Kim and Blake knew they wanted to have a beach wedding, but weren't set on a specific destination. They narrowed the search down to Southern California and Hawaii and hunted down the perfect private venue with a stunning view of the sea. The winner: Olowalu Plantation House in Maui, Hawaii. With visions of a modern seaside bash with a polished Hawaiian island twist, the couple worked with Kara of Your Aloha Wedding Company to plan their May 28, 2015, celebration. Read on to see all of the gorgeous details, as captured by Alison Conklin Photography. END

BEGIN HERE The couple searched high and low for the perfect venue for their intimate wedding. "The more I looked at some other venues, the less private they felt to me," Kim says of other site visits. "If I was going to go all this way to get married, I wanted it to be really secluded. Olowalu Plantation House looked like a tropical paradise and felt like a really iconic Hawaiian backdrop." The views alone could have sold Kim and Blake on the property, but knowing they and their guests would be the only people on the property made it all the more appealing. END
BEGIN HERE The bride and groom worked with LoveLeigh to create their custom island-inspired invitation suite. The cheery yellow color palette felt reminiscent of the Hawaiian landscape while elegant calligraphy and sleek gold foil details gave off the elevated vibe the couple was going for. END

BEGIN HERE As a fashion blogger, Kim knew just how to find the right dress for her walk down the aisle. But that didn't make the process any easier. Like most brides, the Eat.Sleep.Wear founder tried on tons of silhouettes and initially struggled to connect with a gown. "I was doing a lot of bridal editorial for work, so I tried on so many dresses," she says. "I got a great range of what looked good on me and what I liked." Despite that, she found the process of shopping for "the one" awkward. "Everyone talks about it so romantically and you expect to cry," the bride says. "You're trying on dresses that are clamped to you and I just never felt that spark like it was a dress special enough to get married in." Until she visited the Vera Wang boutique, that is. There, she connected with a stylist that totally understood her style and aesthetic, and finally slipped into the strapless stretch Mikado gown with a bias-cut organza skirt that she wore on the big day. "I didn't cry, but I will say I just knew." END
BEGIN HERE The modern silhouette featured a dramatic asymmetrical neckline that felt edgy and chic. She paired the stunning dress with a birdcage veil, classic updo, bold red lip, Valentino pumps, and a neutral bouquet with peonies, ranunculus, and greens. END

He has such a personality and made us laugh and kiss throughout the whole ceremony." END
BEGIN HERE They kept the ceremony décor simple so that the bride's favorite part about the property — the palm trees — could shine. There, the couple recited vows they had written themselves, but it wasn't the first time they had shared them. Prior to the ceremony, the groom and his bride-to-be met to privately say their vows.

BEGIN HERE Your engagement ring will stick close by your side for the rest of your life, just like your fiancé will. So what happens if after they pop the question and slide the ring on your finger, you don't like the shape, the size, or the band that the diamond is sitting in? Is it okay to say something? Is it okay to take it back to the jeweler and see if they can start from scratch and design the ring of your dreams? In the end, your engagement ring should be something you're proud to show off to the world and something that you'll have to look at every single day. If it's not triggering an automatic smile, here are four things you can do to fix that — without offending your fiancé. END
BEGIN HERE   If after a few weeks, you can't stand to wear it and it makes you feel really awful, be honest with your fiancé. Let him know that it's not your style and have specific reasons why. Ask if you can go pick out another ring or make a few changes to it together. Know that this is common and in the end, it can be worked through. Consider it your first marital challenge and find a way to move through it without making anyone feel bad or upset. END

BEGIN HERE Sounds crazy, we know. But science says that having siblings can shape a person's personality (and if you have siblings, you KNOW that's the truth). So here are eight reasons guys who have sisters are total keepers. END
BEGIN HERE Pictures are a huge part of any wedding day, and even though you have a professional photographer around to capture the day, there should be no limit to the number of photos to have. A photographer will ensure that all of the major moments and memories are documented, but there's always room for photo opportunities throughout the night that your photographer may miss. END

BEGIN HERE Are you a bride that loves to customize every detail of your big day? If so, you may want to consider designing your own dress. Whether it's for your wedding or for your rehearsal dinner, the process is fun, meaningful, and totally unique for your wedding. We got some insight into how this is done from Louisa Rechter and Alessandra Perez-Rubio — the ladies behind the ultra-hip fashion brand, Mestiza (seen above). Rechter is engaged herself, and currently in the process of designing not only her wedding dress, but dresses for her rehearsal dinner, after party, mother and bridesmaids! END
BEGIN HERE "It takes 8-9 months to customize a dress," explains Perez-Rubio. The first month is all about searching for fashion inspiration, collecting bits and pieces of details that you love. "As a designer, I've seen lots of dresses over the years," says Rechter, "I picked my favorite embellishments, patterns, and fabrics, then Alessandra helped me merge them into one, flattering design." See below for a sneak peak of what her dress will look like (we LOVE the removable skirt). END
BEGIN HERE Custom Wedding Dress Sketches END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Courtesy of Mestiza    END
BEGIN HERE Once you've built an amazing Pinterest board, it's time to enlist the help of a pattern-maker. If you've never designed a dress, it's crucial that you work with someone who is skilled and experienced — and don't be afraid to interview more than one person. If you live in New York, you can work directly with the ladies behind Mestiza, as they've recently started a customization service. END
BEGIN HERE The process begins with a fitting using a mockup of your dress that's made of muslin, or another inexpensive fabric that's similar in texture to the fabric of your dress. This way, you can evaluate the style and fit, and make any necessary changes to the design. Once complete, the final fabric is ordered and a working garment (one that has unfinished hems in case of modifications) is made. Expect to have 1-2 mid-process fittings before your dress is complete and it's time for the big reveal at your final fitting. END
BEGIN HERE  3 Things to Remember About Your Wedding-Dress Alterations END
BEGIN HERE As best explained by Rechter, at the end of the process you'll have something truly unique, "when all is said and done, you will have an extremely special dress that no one else will have." END
BEGIN HERE "It can be a family heirloom that's passed down through generations" adds Perez-Rubio. We couldn't have said it better ourselves! END
BEGIN HERE As a bridesmaid, a lot of focus and attention goes into the dress. You try it on, you get it fitted and you find the most perfect, and bride-approved accessories for it. But one thing that should earn a little more attention, before the wedding rolls around, is the type of shoes you should pack with you for every occasion. Of course you'll need shoes to compliment the dress, but that's not all! Here are the four types of shoes you should carry with you as you embark on your bridesmaid wedding adventure. END
BEGIN HERE   You'll want a pair of comfy shoes for the morning of the wedding. You never know when you'll be running around the hotel or taking a power walk to a CVS to pick up last minute goodies. These shoes will come in handy! END

BEGIN HERE Come tomorrow, your wedding guests may not recall the train of your wedding dress or you and your new hubby's first dance song, but trust us on this — they will remember just how scrumptious your wedding cake confection was! Big day desserts should wow the crowd, but also tote a melt-in-your-mouth, yummy taste that you and your sweetheart adore. But with so many choices out there (buttercream, fondant, whipped cream — oh my!), what's a bride to do? END

BEGIN HERE Before the fondant-frosted stress gets you feeling overwhelmed, know that choosing a wedding cake is really not as scary as you may think. Just follow Lauren's advice for a sugary sweet success story! END
BEGIN HERE Lauren Bohl White a White Cake END
BEGIN HERE One of her top tips? "Do a little research," Lauren says, advising brides-to-be to have an idea of their likes and dislikes ahead of the first meeting with their baker. "Have a look through some magazines, look through Pinterest. But if you don't know, that's okay. We'll look through portfolios and go from there." Remember, your baker is here to help you have the yummiest big day possible, so don't be scared of asking for a little guidance. END
BEGIN HERE  What Really Happens at a Cake Tasting? END
BEGIN HERE As for the flavor, Lauren wants brides to remember that it's impossible to please everyone — so don't stress about doing so. "If you both love cappuccino espresso cake with hazelnut cream, do it," she says. "Not everyone may love coffee, but if that's what you both love, great." Okay, who else thinks a cappuccino cake sounds amazing right about now? (Thanks for tempting us, Lauren!) END
BEGIN HERE Above all, Lauren stresses not to get overwhelmed by the confection craziness. "It doesn't have to be over the top," she says. At the end of the day, a wedding cake is technically just a dessert. And in our opinion, sugary goodness should always be just as fun as it was when you were kid! END

BEGIN HERE The last wedding-related responsibility you and your fiancé have before you can let loose and just enjoy the wedding reception is the wedding cake cutting. Sounds easy, right? After all, we've all cut birthday cakes, loaves of bread, wedges of cheese, and more before. But have you ever tried to do any of those things while holding the knife with another person? Probably not. We talked to a few experts about how to get closer to that first sweet bite of wedding cake a little bit faster, while still looking totally camera-ready. END
BEGIN HERE   From "his hand over hers" to "cut the bottom layer," there's all sorts of advice on where and how to cut a wedding cake, but Alison Laesser-Keck of VLD Events doesn't listen to any of it. "I think the right way to do it is whatever works best for the couple. Just have fun with it!" she says. So whether you opt for a box, a slice, a wedge, or to just dig in to the top tier with a fork, there's no wrong way to cut a wedding cake. END
BEGIN HERE You know that all of your friends dropped thousands of dollars on their wedding flowers, and while you want your wedding day to be beautiful, posies are just not your main priority. So how can you keep your wedding flower budget under control without looking cheap? END
BEGIN HERE The first thing to keep in mind is that your wedding venue is beautiful in its own right, and you don't have to spend a fortune to gild the lily. But there are some insider tricks that professionals use to cut costs, which you, as a bride-to-be in the know, are totally allowed to steal. END
BEGIN HERE   The petals will stay fresher longer if you wait to strip them off the roses the day before the wedding, rather than buying something that's been wilting in bags for a few days.

BEGIN HERE  9 Things Bridesmaids Should Leave at Home END
BEGIN HERE After answering those questions as well as checking your schedule and your budget, if you feel as though you want to run for the hills, far away from your bridesmaid duties, it's important to first take a deep breath and a step back. There is a grace period after accepting your bridesmaid duties when you can go back and decline — but that window is only a couple of days. Either way, it's important to decide exactly what the reason is behind not wanting to be a bridesmaid anymore. If it's finances, speak with the maid of honor or bride and let them know your concerns. Perhaps there are ways you can contribute to the events without putting money down. If it's time that you're concerned about, be open and honest, letting them know your previous commitments and what you'll be able to do and when. END

Almost three years later, Blanock's Go Fund Me Page has reported that this inspirational teen's cancer has spread, and that the results are terminal. END

And after seeing dozens of photos of the two canoodling at various Hollywood date spots — and even at a friend's wedding! — we just know there's something special going on between the sweet singers. However, the pretty-much-confirmed couple has been staying rather mum when it comes to their much talked about relationship. But leave it to Ellen DeGeneres to ask Stefani what we've been positively dying to know... Just how did Blake pop the big question?! END
BEGIN HERE Okay, so we may be getting a little bit ahead of ourselves considering that we're already hearing wedding bells for the twosome, but apparently we're not the only ones! According to E! News, during Stefani's recent appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the hilarious talkshow host couldn't help but sneak in the "big" question during their interview. END
BEGIN HERE Pulling up the cutest couple photos she could find of Shelton and Stefani, DeGeneres drove right in. "So, let's talk about Blake," she said to the "Make Me Like You" singer, who immediately began giggling and blushing adorably. "When he popped the big question — about you being his mentor — how did he do that?" she asked. Wait, what?! END
BEGIN HERE Turns out, DeGeneres was just slyly referencing the pair's current gig on The Voice, but the joke was not lost on Stefani. "Did you rehearse that before?" the NBC singing coach asked with a laugh. "Yeah, I did," DeGeneres admitted, smiling. END
BEGIN HERE Trying to move the conversation from her sweetheart to their popular reality competition show, Stefani said, "I want to be on that show as much as possible... I got so much out of it." END
BEGIN HERE "You did!" DeGeneres hilariously interjected, alluding to her romantic relationship. Yup, that's for sure! END
BEGIN HERE  Our Favorite Celebrity Engagement Rings END
BEGIN HERE For some brides the process of planning their dream fairytale wedding can actually be a nightmare. Instead of envisioning a large affair where every detail is planned to the second, some brides would rather jet off and elope in an intimate and private celebration. Turns out, actress Amy Adams and her husband Darren Le Gallo had plans to elope privately, but their pre-wedding celebrations actually got in the way! END
BEGIN HERE The now-married couple was in Las Vegas where they planned to tie the knot in private, but it seems like Vegas actually got the best of them. "We wanted to find a chaplain, go to the desert and get married at sunset," she revealed in the April 2016 issue of Marie Claire UK. "But to be honest, we got too drunk. Then it was just not going to happen." So it's probably a good thing they waited — nobody wants a Hangover style wedding. END
BEGIN HERE The two announced their engagement in July 2008, but waited seven years to tie the knot. It's understandable why the two waited so long to make it official — they had a busy seven years between the ring and the nuptials. During that time they celebrated four Oscar nominations and welcomed their first child, Aviana Olea. It's no surprise there wasn't any time to plan a wedding! END
BEGIN HERE Finally, after 14 years together the two made it down the aisle in a quiet spring ceremony in California in 2015. Other than that, the quiet couple hasn't divulged any more details from their wedding. We're still left daydreaming about what Adams' dress looked like... sigh. END
BEGIN HERE After all those years together you'd think Adams and Le Gallo would have this whole marriage thing down. Adams admitted to the magazine, however, it wasn't as easy of an adjustment as she thought it would be. "I definitely feel like I can't make empty threats," she said. "Before, I could be like, 'I'm just going to go down and get a hotel room, and I'm going [to] think this through!' Though I'm making myself sound horrible to this poor, awesome guy. Relationships are hard. I think what I learned is, you just have to make a choice. Marriage is a choice." END
BEGIN HERE There's nothing quite like a movie wedding! Some of our favorite bridal moments have come from the silver screen — Four Weddings and a Funeral, The Sound of Music, Runaway Bride, and The Wedding Planner, just to name a few. But rom-coms aren't the only ones that get all the love, plenty of Oscar-nominated films have had their fair share of wedding magic.

In July of 2014, he asked Ali to join him on a hike at Rabbit Ears Pass in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, and when the pair reached the summit, he popped the question. So when they started planning their August 15, 2015, wedding, it seemed only natural to return to the mountain town they love to tie the knot. So they planned a mountaintop reception followed by a reception 9,080 feet above sea level. END
BEGIN HERE With stunning Steamboat and the Rocky Mountains as the backdrop for their big day, Ali and Moses knew they wanted the wedding to be casual yet elegant with a romantic mountain theme. "The view from the top of the mountain is unbeatable and we wanted to share this special place and its natural beauty with our guests," Ali says. So, with 210 guests in tow, the couple rode the gondola to the very top of the mountain — seriously! — and exchanged vows while taking in near panoramic-views of the surrounding mountains.

BEGIN HERE Ali wanted a wedding dress that felt different and unique, and she found just what she was looking for in the second dress she tired on: an embroidered silk charmeuse Claire Pettibone gown. "It was so me," she says. "My mom agreed. I just stopped looking after that because I knew the more dresses I tried on the more confused I would get." The bride admits she cried when she purchased the stunning style, but not out of joy. "I didn't cry because I was so happy, but because I spent so much money! That being said, it was worth it. I felt like a million bucks in that dress." END
BEGIN HERE Looking back, she has no regrets about the figure-flattering gown. She accessorized with vintage white cowboy boots, her sister's sapphire ring and matching drop earrings, and a bracelet her mother made out of pearls and charms from jewelry that had belonged to both of the bride's grandmothers. Her bouquet was the perfect fit for the natural terrain around their ceremony and reception. The semi-cascading arrangement was packed with succulents, butterfly bush sprigs, eucalyptus, and garden roses. END

BEGIN HERE   In a healthy marriage, couples get turned on in and outside the bedroom. "They turn each other on intellectually," Coleman explains.

And most importantly, it's never boring." END
BEGIN HERE Having real flowers at your wedding can be a mighty expense. Flowers eat up a big chunk of your wedding budget and while they do a good job of making the room look and smell lovely, they go to complete waste at the end of the night. So perhaps you're looking to use flowers here and there or to use none altogether. Either way, there's no need to panic over what you will replace the flowers with when it comes to a bouquet. To help you think of a fun and pretty replacement, here are four alternatives to have a flower-filled bouquet. END
BEGIN HERE   You can mix and match different shaped and sized balloons to make a bouquet that gives off a more youthful and fun overall look. This is a rather unique idea that will save you a lot of money and even make your bouquet something that people talk about long after the wedding is over. Bonus? You can use these balloons afterward to fill up space in the wedding venue or decorate the ceiling of the dance floor. END

BEGIN HERE A single mistake may not cost you your marriage. But commit any of these spousal sins, our expert says, and your marriage could turn sour. Here are the most common relationship blunders to avoid in your marriage — and what healthy best practices to do instead. END
BEGIN HERE   Your marriage is hardly the only thing you have going on. And with so many things and people competing for your time, you may find "the squeaky wheel gets attention — the children, your job, your cell phone," says Doares. "It's easy to let your relationship take a back seat, especially if there aren't any 'real' problems. But marriage behavior should be as good or better than courtship behavior if you expect it to survive." Rather than letting your marriage come in last, Doares says, you should make time for it first. "You tell people what is important to you by how you spend your time," she says. "If you aren't spending time in your marriage, you are telling your spouse that it isn't important to you. Finding a sustainable balance between work, home, and self can be challenging but it is doable. It is also necessary for the long-term health of your marriage." END

BEGIN HERE Weddings are all about celebrating love, but often times it's not just about the love between the couple getting married. Sometimes it's about new found and newly formed love that starts inside of the wedding party. So when the bridesmaids and the groomsmen come together and spend time with one another during the wedding adventure, you may ask yourself if it's okay for crushes to develop and for even, possibly, the maid of honor and the best man to grow smitten for one another. END
BEGIN HERE Your initial thought may be that if your maid of honor is off exchanging googly eyes with the best man, that she won't have time to be there for you or that she'll be totally distracted. But the truth is, it won't be a problem. If anything, it will add to her excitement toward the whole wedding and will bond her even more to the responsibilities of the wedding weekend. END

BEGIN HERE "My husband proposed on a Scrabble board. It's a game we've always loved. He glued the letters on, spelling 'AMANDA WILL YOU MARRY ME,' and then asked if I wanted to play the game after dinner. He had me set up the game, and of course when I opened the board, I saw the letters spelling out the proposal! I framed the board and have it hanging in our home." — Amanda END
BEGIN HERE "My fiancé is a software engineer in the Silicon Valley. To propose, he learned a new programming language (iOS) and built a husband app (from scratch!) that he called "House Boy." The app had screens to select food choice, wine choice, whether I wanted laundry folded, etc. It also had screens for his top three memories in our relationship thus far — and three hopes for our future. The next screen asked, 'Will You Marry Me?' and had music to accompany it — which was the trigger for him to get down on one knee and propose. For my birthday, he is revising the app to be a husband app, so I can use during my long commutes home from work." — Gaelen END

BEGIN HERE "A road trip from Florida to Indiana more than 26 years ago with my then-boyfriend changed my life. I didn't know how to ski, so when he asked me to go skiing in another state and then tried to convince me to get on an extremely high ski lift, I truly thought he had lost his mind and didn't know me at all. I was terrified, but for some reason, I relented and said a very serious prayer inside my head as we made our way to the lift. Having never been on skis before, it took a few human pile-ups before I actually figured out how to be 'captured' by the lift seat as it went by. While on the chairlift, I made peace with my life and peered down below with the queasy realization that I was going to be dumped at the top of the hill — and that would likely be one of my last visions (besides legs and arms flailing all the way down the mountain). I turned to him with fear in my eyes, and before I could say a word, he had pulled out a jewelry box with an engagement ring, and offered me the sweetest declaration of love and forever friendship I could have ever imagined. He put the ring on my finger, and we kissed. I didn't have to go down the hill, but at that point, I felt a burst of confidence, and I held tight to his hand and together we jumped at the designated time. There was another human pile-up, then, down we went! I fell at least 400 times all the way down the hill...but with a ring on my finger!" — Sherry END

Mentioning things like, 'you're stubborn, you can be opinionated, you have a temper,' etc., and then after what felt like a list of 30 faults (I'm sure he mentioned the same ones numerous times...), he said, 'but I love you, so will you marry me?'

BEGIN HERE Napa Valley may be the most famous wine region in Northern California, and the US. It's even one of the most iconic wine destinations in the world. But, unbeknownst to many visitors, its next-door neighbor is just as enticing. If a wine-tasting honeymoon is your dream, consider honeymooning in Sonoma instead! END
BEGIN HERE The first big difference between Napa and Sonoma is size. While Napa County covers more than 800 square miles, the Napa Valley, where the bulk of the more than 400 wineries in the region are clustered, stretches only about 35 miles from north to south. Sonoma County sprawls more than 1,600 square miles and though it has nearly the same number of wineries as Napa, they're spread over a much larger area, ranging from the cool, dry Carneros region to the warm Alexander Valley, and from the mountains to the coast. This not only means a wider diversity in landscapes to explore, but a wider diversity in wines; while Napa is mostly known for big, rich cabernets, the wines of Sonoma range from earthy Pinot Noirs to peppery Zinfandels, cool-climate Syrahs, and flavorful Chardonnays. END
BEGIN HERE If you're a connoisseur who loves cabs or wants to visit some of the most famous names in California wines, Napa is the place to go, but for a well-rounded tasting experience, you'll get more variety in Sonoma. From gorgeous hotels and wineries, to outdoor adventures on the ocean and river, here are a few more reasons you should reconsider that Napa honeymoon and plan a trip to Sonoma instead. END
BEGIN HERE   While Napa's main towns each have their own personality, the main activity in each one is wine tasting. Sonoma's location between the mountains and the coast means that you can enjoy a wider variety of activities, and the distance between towns means each one is unique in its setting and offerings. END
BEGIN HERE The resort towns of Guerneville and Monte Rio have a more relaxed feel, and the main draw is the proximity to the Russian River, where you can kayak, or play along the sandy shores. The quaint Russian River wine country towns of Sebastopol, Forestville, and Occidental, provide easy access to ancient trees at Armstrong Redwoods National Park and plenty of opportunities for fine dining, wine tasting and other refined pursuit. Jenner and Bodega Bay (the setting for the Hitchcock classic, The Birds) are perfect for those who want equal opportunities for wine tasting and coastal activities like kayaking. And larger towns like Healdsburg, Sonoma, or Santa Rosa are surrounded by dining, shopping, and wine tasting. No matter which town you choose, you'll never be more than a short drive from a vineyard, forest, river, or the coast. END
BEGIN HERE Sometimes the very best things happen when you least expect it. Just ask David Barnhart and Kevin Ford, who first met when David hired Kevin as a personal trainer. "We became best friends, and the rest is history!" says David. In August of 2013, Kevin and David both knew they wanted to get married. They decided to propose to each other, so they took a secret trip to Napa Valley. "Kevin surprised me. He had the rings we'd bought [to eventually use as wedding bands] with him on our sunrise hot air balloon ride, and we spontaneously exchanged rings and proposed to one another," says David. Their planners, Jamie and Kate of Simply Chic Events, latched on to the hot air balloon theme, infusing the grooms' reception with vibrant hues and mixing in woven elements to mimic the balloon baskets. END
BEGIN HERE An unexpected twist? The weather. The original plan had been an intimate Friday evening ceremony for 110 guests in their Georgetown backyard on June 13, 2014, followed by a formal dinner at Tudor Place, a gorgeous property across the street, and then a festive bash for 230 the next evening. "A few days before the wedding, we realized it was going to be pouring, so we changed the schedule," says Kevin. Instead, they had a formal pre-wedding dinner on Friday night, then asked the guests to come to their home on Saturday before the party to witness the backyard ceremony. Once vows were exchanged, they headed to The Powerhouse for the reception. "We were lucky that the ceremony was at our home, so we could change the schedule as needed," says David. And even with the hiccups, it was absolutely stunning. But don't take our word for it — see the breathtaking details below, photographed by Jose Villa. END

BEGIN HERE Figuring out who to tip on your wedding day (and how much) might seem complicated, but we've got guidelines to help you navigate it, and some vendors even include gratuity percentages in their contract to simplify it for you. Once you've figured out how much to give, the question is: How should you distribute tips? Our experts have a few ideas for making wedding-day tipping totally stress-free. END
BEGIN HERE Think about who you'll want or need to tip a few weeks in advance, instead of the morning of your wedding. This will give you time to write checks, go to the bank for cash, and jot down thank you notes to include in each envelope, instead of asking your dad to locate his check book as the hair stylist is heading out the door. END
BEGIN HERE While you're at it, put each vendor's first and last name on the envelope, and in parentheses write the service they're providing. This way, if you've got the best man or your brother handing tips out, they'll know Susan Brown is the caterer and they can look for her in the kitchen instead of wandering around asking if anyone has seen Susan. You could also ask your wedding planner if they can help you distribute gratuities at the end of the evening, ideally as different vendors are packing up so they're not in the middle of service or rocking out on stage. Have a few extra $20s, envelopes, and cards on-hand in case you realize there's someone you've forgotten. END
BEGIN HERE If it's a vendor who doesn't usually receive a tip (such as the florist, cake baker, or your wedding planner's assistant) but who really blew you away on your wedding day, send a tip in the mail in the days immediately following your wedding. Be sure to include a note thanking them for going above and beyond! It will be an unexpected surprise, and the mail is an easier way to get a check to a vendor who you may not see personally during your wedding. END
BEGIN HERE Blame it on technology  and our ever-waning attention spans, but nobody, especially your guests, likes waiting in line. And who can blame them? Nowadays, more and more brides and grooms are seeking creative, alternative ways to greet their guests without cutting into valuable wedding time. So as not to waste anyone's time (yours included), say, "I do!" to these modern alternatives to the traditional receiving line. END
BEGIN HERE   According to Malone, most destination brides and grooms don't even bother with a receiving line at their wedding because they've already spent the entire weekend with their guests, hosting welcome parties and rehearsal events. By the time the big day arrives, they've hung out with everybody there so there's no point in wasting good party time standing in a formal line when they could be having fun with their friends and family, she points out. "With that said though, it is important for destination brides and grooms to make a real effort to visit with guests for an extended period during the welcome party and other pre-wedding events they host so that everybody who travelled far feels like they got in good face time." END
BEGIN HERE When it comes to wedding photography and your overall bridal look, it can't be denied that your bridesmaids are an integral part of your overall aesthetic. Making sure your best girls look as fierce and phenomenal as you do when walking down the aisle is an important factor in wedding-day preparations — which shouldn't be taken lightly. This round-up of Houston's most celebrated bridesmaid boutiques offers a diverse variety of luxury and contemporary gowns which can be personalized for every member of your bridal squad. END

John Legend has been known to take a break from serenading his wife Chrissy Teigen from time to time to croon to newlyweds on the reception dance floor. Last year, Ed Sheeran also crashed a wedding to surprise the couple with an impromptu performance. Even Justin Timberlake and Chris Martin previously worked a few nuptial gigs. Bet none of them can add royalty to their resume, though! END

BEGIN HERE Goulding performed a rendition of Elton John's "Your Song" for Prince William and Kate Middleton's first dance — an epic moment, we're sure, but her nerves are what sticks out the most when the singer recalls the performance. "That's one of my memories, looking down at [my hand] and just seeing this," she said, giving a quick reenactment of her quivering hands. END
BEGIN HERE Despite her stardom and brilliant voice, Goulding didn't even believe she was going to actually get to perform for the royal couple, leading up to the ceremony. "I thought I was a decoy," she admitted. "I thought I was a decoy for someone else. It could happen! At the time, Gaga was everywhere, and rightly so, she was killing it, and you know, Beyoncé and Jay-Z, and then you know, me." END

We asked real brides to share the small gestures that make their men say, "Best wifey ever!" END
BEGIN HERE   "I slip a little note in his lunch about once a week. When we got married, my mom sent me a book of tear out love notes to surprise him with, and there are a ton in there. I'm talking like 200! It's fun to flip through and find one that's fitting for that particular day or week. I usually add my own note as well, and he thinks it's so cute — but still has no idea where the pre-written love notes come from!" — Janel  END
BEGIN HERE With wedding season fast approaching, it's no surprise that engaged ladies are on the hunt for gorgeous wedding inspiration.

BEGIN HERE They often say that the wedding ceremony is for the couple and the wedding reception is for the guests. After all, they're gathering from far and wide to support your marriage, so creating an evening that honors and celebrates the role they play in your lives is a priority (as is the fun!). A big part of playing host or hostess is making sure all of your guests are comfortable, and this includes guests that have limited mobility, whether it's a permanent disability or they're pregnant or have a broken leg. How can a couple make sure everyone feels attended to and taken care of? Here are some tips from our experts on accommodating guests who have a harder time getting around. END
BEGIN HERE If you know you'll be inviting guests with limited mobility, keep it in mind from the start. When you're looking at venues, think about alternative options for moving around the space. Is there a ramp that circumvents the dramatic front steps? An elevator to bring a guest who isn't steady on the stairs from the entryway up to the reception space? A paved walkway that leads across the lawn to the ceremony site? And don't forget to check out the bathrooms! Make sure there is at least one accessible bathroom available on-site (meaning it's got enough space for a wheelchair or walker, and has a handrail on the wall to provide extra stability). If you can find a venue that has a lot of these accommodations built in, you'll be able to rest easy knowing those guests who have a harder time getting around have an alternative option. END
BEGIN HERE You can also take measures to make the space a little more accessible. If there are only two or three steps from the driveway to the front door, be sure to station an usher or a member of the waitstaff at the door to offer a hand to anyone who needs help getting up the stairs. You could also have a temporary ramp installed for easier access. Encourage a guest who needs a little more time to head toward the ceremony and take a seat early (again, with help from an usher). And rent a few extra chairs for cocktail hour to make sure there's a spot to sit for anyone who might like it. If someone in the wedding party or your immediate family has a disability and uses a wheelchair or walker, design a wider aisle so they can get to the altar with ease. Have a pregnant bridesmaid? Consider placing her on the end, and have a chair or stool available for her perch during your vows. Be mindful when planning the seating chart, too. Seat guests with limited mobility closer to the door and on the side of the table that is more open — this way they won't have to weave through a sea of chairs to find their seat. END
BEGIN HERE 5 Signs a Ceremony Site Is Perfect For Your Wedding END
BEGIN HERE And of course, check with any of your guests who might have limited mobility to see if there are accommodations you didn't know they'd need. It might take a little extra planning on your end, but you'll be happy to know they're comfortable when your wedding day arrives. END
BEGIN HERE There's nothing wrong with saying "I love you." But as Lesli Doares, marriage coach and author of Blueprint for a Lasting Marriage, explains, "one of the challenges to 'I love you' is that it doesn't always mean the same thing to the two of you." Whispering other more specific sweet nothings, on the other hand, "shows that you are paying attention to your spouse and what they are doing," she says. So, here are five such sentiments you can start saying, stat. END
BEGIN HERE   Says Coleman, "It is essential that people feel heard by their intimate partner." And while we don't always have to agree with our spouses, "fully listening and accepting them is still possible and essential when two people are struggling with an issue that they have very different feelings about or proposed solutions to," Coleman explains. "This is an important first step to compromise and finding win-win solutions, which are the only ones that work." END
BEGIN HERE When it comes to preparing for your wedding, a lot of the tasks can be time-consuming and logistical — let alone a bit stressful. However, when it's finally time to start thinking about your decor, style, and 'somethings,' your 'something blue' is where you can get your creative juices flowing and start to have a little fun. Sure, a blue garter for the reception toss is a flirty and fantastic idea, but there are some Chicago boutiques where you'll find blue options that are truly unique. END

This time around, the "I do's" were said by former Voice contestation RaeLynn Woodward and her love Josh Davis, who got hitched in Nashville, Tennessee on Saturday. And if Stefani was on the hunt for some wedding inspiration, trust us, she definitely got some "I do" inspo from this beautiful bride! END
BEGIN HERE The successful country singer, who was coached by Shelton during her season two run on The Voice, definitely had a vision for her big day. "My main thing was I just wanted everybody to have a good time, you know," RaeLynn explained to Us Weekly. "I wanted to make sure we had the best DJ in town. And I love table decorations. I want every table to have its own little thing. So that's my main thing is I just want to create a cool atmosphere." END
BEGIN HERE Is a friend's rustic-chic barn cool enough for you? The sweethearts tied the knot in a local barn and enhanced its cool, country vibe with "a whimsical, woodland theme" full of pale pink and burgundy hues and on-trend succulents. The reception noshes also toted a country-chic air, as RaeLynn and her new hubby embraced southern homecooking and offered dishes like BBQ chicken, shrimp and grits, macaroni and cheese, and butternut squash soup. Yum! END
BEGIN HERE  The Most Iconic Celebrity Brides END
BEGIN HERE And no worries on the dress front! The bride's gorgeous gown was just as impressive as her famous voice. For her walk down the aisle, RaeLynn wore a tulle ballgown that featured an intricately-detailed illusion back and chic cap sleeves. Her bridal party was also looking lovely, as she had her 17 bridesmaids (yes, seventeen bridesmaids...) match her bridal-white ensemble in similarly creamy hues. END
BEGIN HERE "I was looking over the RSVP list and seeing who's all coming, and it's just a reminder of how blessed I am," RaeLynn said of her 300 guests.

First celeb hairstylist Amanda Craig's wedding in January and now this? Getting any ideas there, Gwen? END
BEGIN HERE A baby changes everything, including your marriage. But this is one change you can anticipate, and for which you can prepare — and our experts are here to tell you how. END
BEGIN HERE   It's not enough to know how a baby will change your lives, our experts say. You must talk about how you anticipate the changes will affect every aspect of your lives — including how you feel emotionally. "This part of the process is so important because having the baby takes attention, focus, and energy away from your partner," explains Duffy. Very often people wind up feeling neglected, ignored, abandoned, not considered, and not important even though they know these feelings can't be healthy for the baby to be around. Being aware that you may feel resentful or jealous is helpful because then you can talk about it and figure out how to balance those emotions." END
BEGIN HERE Greer recommends initiating an open and honest conversation about how you think you'll be most affected, and continuing that conversation — revising your plan as often as needed — until the baby comes and even after. "Be open to making changes and modifying the plan you have for how you're going to care for your infant," she says. "For example, you may decide to bring on a nanny, based on what each of you is comfortable and able to handle." END
BEGIN HERE When it comes to having children, you may think you've got all the time in the world. But a research study shows that depending on how many children you ultimately want, you may need to get busy stat. END
BEGIN HERE For their study, Netherlands researchers created a computer model that simulated the situations of 10,000 real couples trying to conceive, taking into account the chances a couple would get pregnant in a given month, the likelihood the pregnancy would be lost, and the chance the couple would be found infertile. With that data, the researchers were able to estimate the maximum age at which a woman should try to get pregnant based on how many children she wants — and whether she's open to in vitro fertilization (IVF). END
BEGIN HERE For example, a woman who wants at least a 90-percent shot at having a child — and who isn't willing to use IVF — should start trying to conceive no later than age 32, the researchers found. A woman who wants two children should start getting busy by 27. The good news, however, is that those same women could each wait another 10 years if they were willing to use IVF, according to the study. END
BEGIN HERE  6 Things You Should Do Before Having Kids END
BEGIN HERE This study begs an important question of couples who are looking to balance their careers with their desire to start a family: Can you wait too long to try? Mary Jane Minkin, M.D., Clinical Professor of OB-GYN at Yale School of Medicine, says that before you worry over whether you're waiting too long, you have another question to ask yourself: "How devastated would you be if you couldn't have a baby?" she asks. Depending on your answer, you'll know how seriously to take her next points and this research. END
BEGIN HERE Once you have your answer, consider this: Unless you have already-established infertility issues, "the numbers are really pretty good before you hit 35," says Minkin, "and they're not bad from 36 to 40. The real break in the success curve is at about 40 — with really not good numbers beyond 42." Even with IVF, your chances of getting pregnant after age 42 are slim, she says. Of course, Minkin is quick to point out that if a woman is in good physical health and is willing to use donor eggs, "then success is really quite good beyond 42." END
BEGIN HERE Minkin mostly agrees with the researchers' findings. "Should numbers of pregnancies count? Absolutely," she says. "So if you'd like to have three kids, then I would start by age 34 or 35 having one every two years. If you only want one kid and you've hit that age, then it's OK to wait a little longer." But to ease your mind, Minkin adds, "I can tell you that I've delivered one woman at age 45, and she has done fabulously. I've also delivered three 47-year-old women who weren't planning their pregnancies — it just happened for them, so it can happen for others." END
BEGIN HERE As much as I have written about spoiling sessions, extended sex dates, and becoming an expert on your partner's sexual arousal, there's something that I feel like I have left out of the equation from my writing. END
BEGIN HERE That's right... quickies. END
BEGIN HERE It's easy for quickies to get the cold shoulder. END
BEGIN HERE They might not open your heart as deeply... but they also don't take hours of planning, foreplay, or communication. END
BEGIN HERE Because sometimes being taken against a wall is just what the doctor ordered. Or in a stair well... or in front of a mirror... or on the kitchen counter... you get the picture. END
BEGIN HERE Maybe you and your partner are about to go your separate ways for work and the mood strikes you. END
BEGIN HERE Maybe they walk past you in a certain way when you were trying to concentrate on reading your book. END
BEGIN HERE Or maybe you haven't seen each other in almost a week because one of you was traveling and "Holy hell I just need to have you right now!" END
BEGIN HERE It doesn't matter what the reason is. END
BEGIN HERE Quickies are amazing. END
BEGIN HERE Need some convincing to occasionally skip the extended foreplay? END
BEGIN HERE Here are the top three reasons that you should incorporate quickies into your sexual repertoire more often. END
BEGIN HERE They're one of the cutest parts of a wedding, but flower girls and ring bearers can also be some of the most needy and hard-to-handle members of a wedding party. They're tiny, energetic, need snacks and attention, and aren't quite old enough to power through if they haven't had their nap. So what can you do if some of the littlest members of the wedding party aren't so excited about their big moment? Our experts have a few tips. END
BEGIN HERE If it's a slightly older child, the best place to start is always with snacks. Natural gummy snacks are a great option (and are more parent-friendly than the artificial variety). Hand a few out to the ring bearers or flower girls before the ceremony, and put extras in a bag beneath a seat in the first or second row (the mother of the bride, mother of the groom, or a grandmother's seat). Be sure to let the occupant of the seat know they're on snack duty, of course! Then let the kids know that they can have a few bites now, and will get more once they've finished their job. END
BEGIN HERE If your flower girl or ring bearer is younger, pair them up with an older wedding party member (either an additional flower girl or ring bearer or someone like a junior bridesmaid or usher) to head down the aisle. That very cool big kid will be able to lead the way, as well as set a good example and provide some encouragement. END
BEGIN HERE If Mom or Dad is in the wedding party, be prepared to make a last-minute change to the processional in the event of an inconsolable flower girl or ring bearer who really insists on being carried. If you're concerned whether the youngest members of your wedding party will be able to get down the aisle alone, you may want to build this in to your processional plan from the get-go. END
BEGIN HERE And what if, halfway down the aisle, all of the oohs and aahs and strangers simply becomes too much and there's a meltdown? First of all, remember how incredibly adorable these photos can be! Then just roll with it. Whether Mom leaves the altar for a moment to come to the rescue or Grandpa steps out of his seat, it's usually nothing a familiar face can't fix. END

BEGIN HERE The Oscar winner posted a snap with her gorgeous golden statue front and center but the focus of the pic was her growing baby bump. Unlike expectant mom Chrissy Teigen, Hathaway didn't accessorize her bump with a couture gown, just a white t-shirt with a big heart on the front. END
BEGIN HERE She captioned the adorable snap "favorite Oscar day ever, good luck to everyone at the show! #oscars" and we can totally understand why. We can't lie, it would be pretty fun to have the hottest designers dress you and to spend the day being prepped and pampered, but spending the night home in your coziest clothes with your baby bump is a pretty great alternative to the red carpet.

BEGIN HERE Like anyone new to, well, anything, newlyweds are bound to make a few mistakes. "It's common for newlyweds to make mistakes in their marriages because they don't grasp that marriage is not like any other relationship they have ever been in," says Lesli Doares, marriage coach and author of Blueprint For a Lasting Marriage. END
BEGIN HERE "Their mistakes aren't ones of intention but of truly not knowing what is now required," Doares continues. "But this lack of information is not only unrecognized but not always easy to remedy." How, you ask? By sidestepping these seven super-common marriage mistakes from the start. END
BEGIN HERE   When you tie the knot, you're at the height of your romance and it seems nothing can break you out of this love bubble. But, says Doares, "it is really easy for newlyweds to get overwhelmed by the day-to-day grind. The relationship is okay and everything else needs immediate attention. But nothing thrives on neglect and it's much easier to keep a relationship healthy than try to get it back into shape later." END
BEGIN HERE Don't take your good relationship for granted. "Newlyweds need to continue to date and have fun regularly," Doares says. "They need to continue to be nice and kind to each other on a daily basis. Developing rituals and habits that remind them what they love about each other and why they wanted to go on this journey together will keep the marriage on the track to success." END

BEGIN HERE At its best, sex is usually more about pleasure than pain. But sometimes when you're in pursuit of that pleasure, you put your health at risk, potentially without even realizing it. There are plenty of popular sex tips you might either be curious about or already consider part of your sexual repertoire, but that also aren't as safe as you may think. The good news: even though the following 10 sex tips can be a little dangerous, there are expert-approved ways to enjoy them (almost) risk-free. END
BEGIN HERE You may think that a teeny, tiny little lie — a fib by omission or noncommittal answer to a pointed question — will have no negative consequences in your otherwise solid relationship. But, says relationship expert and etiquette columnist April Masini, "keeping things from your spouse breeds mistrust in a marriage. And when you or your spouse don't trust each other, you're always looking over your shoulder, waiting for the other shoe to drop and wondering if what they said they did is true. This dynamic tends to snowball and it's very hard to get out from under." END
BEGIN HERE On the flip side, she says, "sharing with your spouse breeds intimacy and that's a basis for the best relationships. The stronger the intimacy you have with your spouse, the quicker you develop a unique shorthand with them and the kind of trust that brings better sex, deeper love and stronger decisions making skills as a couple." END
BEGIN HERE So with the goal of building a stronger bond and not breeding distrust, here are six things our experts say you should never keep from your spouse. END
BEGIN HERE   You shouldn't hide your former relationships, says Masini, no matter how short-lived they may have been. "You may think it's no big deal, but when this ex suddenly shows up, seven years later, your husband will not be happy — and will wonder if you have any other former husbands hiding under rocks," she warns. "Disclose your past marriages and serious relationships so your husband isn't sabotaged by a surprise ex visit or phone call." END
BEGIN HERE A year and a half after the undisputed king of Hollywood married his queen, George and Amal Clooney have some useful marriage advice to bestow upon us common folk. While some of their martial struggles (fame, paparazzi, what suit and gown combo would best complement the red carpet...) don't really apply to most of us, the A-list pair still deal with one of the most common relationship conflicts — long-distance love. With an A-list actor hubby and an intentional human rights lawyer wife, this is one couple who knows the struggle of bi-continental relationships. So just how do they manage to keep fanning the flame of their romance between fighting for human rights and starring in Hollywood blockbusters? Well, read on because Clooney is revealing the secret behind their long-distance love. END
BEGIN HERE "We have a rule whereby we are never apart for more than a week," the Money Monster star said, according to Us Weekly. While we find it adorable that these two can't stand more than a mere seven days apart, something tells us that having millions of dollars at their disposal definitely makes sticking to that rule a bit easier. So, what about those who can't abide by their one week rule? "We also stay in touch via social media, so we try to keep close even if we're in different parts of the world," Clooney also noted. Now, that we can definitely do... END
BEGIN HERE Having several homes around the globe also helps these busy bees stay connected. (We were totally right about that whole money thing...) "We have a place in London now where it's easy for us to spend a lot of time together and I can work on new film projects — writing, reading scripts," Clooney explained. "Or we can go to Lake Como or spend time in Los Angeles when I need to have meetings for my acting work." END
BEGIN HERE Meanwhile, while her hubby is schmoozing with Hollywood's elite, Amal has been working as an international rights advocate for the prestigious Doughty Street Chambers in Britain. Slay, girl! END

BEGIN HERE "It takes some planning, but it's actually been working out very well for us," Clooney concluded. "What really brings us together as a couple is the fact that we're good friends and we enjoy each other's company." Okay, so while most of us don't have limitless funds at our disposal, the star's long-distance advice still hangs true. Make an effort, savor your time with your spouse, and a sweet shout-out at the Golden Globes sure doesn't hurt, either! END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Giphy    END
BEGIN HERE Paying for a good wedding photographer can make a major dent in your wedding budget and for good reason — your wedding photos will be one of the most cherished and important pieces after your wedding is over and they'll stick with you and your husband as wonderful memories for years and years to come. So it's important to realize that just because you're on tight budget, that doesn't mean you have to sacrifice the wedding photos of your dreams. END
BEGIN HERE The most important thing to do when reaching out to wedding photographers is to be up-front about your budget. Many photographers post packages with set prices on their website, while some prefer to give you a custom quote. Usually, they'll tweak a package to suit your needs and your budget. But if the price is fixed, try negotiating: Choose a less expensive package and ask to have extras thrown in, like an engagement shoot or a canvas print. You can also send your shooter home early to save (smart-phone pics can cover the rest of the reception) or wait on albums and prints (e.g., buy them after the wedding when your bank account has recovered, or use a service to print independently). One thing to remember is that even if the pro you want is expensive, it may be worth the cost: Flowers wilt, but photos last. END
BEGIN HERE You collected RSVP cards (you even numbered them so you'd know who forgot to include their name!), called and emailed to follow up, and finally sent that wedding guest count to the caterer. And then it happens: That person you were so, so sure wasn't coming to your wedding is making a beeline straight for you after the ceremony, to both give you a hug and let you know they couldn't find their escort card. Now what?! Here's how our experts say you should handle an unexpected guest at your wedding. END
BEGIN HERE It's not an ideal situation, but thankfully wedding vendors are totally prepared to handle the arrival of someone you weren't expecting at your wedding. The caterer always has a few extra meals on-hand, and even if the plates won't match and the chair is a standard banquet instead of the gold chivaris you rented, it can be squeezed in at the one table where you had nine guests instead of 10. So thankfully, accommodating an extra guests isn't too much of a logistical hassle. END
BEGIN HERE Of course, you're busy! You're in the middle of having your wedding! So don't take any of this upon yourself. Talk to your planner or the venue's banquet manager and let them know that you'll need to add a guest to one of the tables. Then let them take over: They can communicate with the other vendors, as well as gracefully let your surprise attendee know where he or she will be sitting. If the unexpected guest is a distant family member, but Grandma's table is full, see if one of your younger cousins wouldn't mind grabbing a seat with your college buddies so Aunt Mable can sit with the folks she knows. Sure, it might be a little cozier at that table than you'd planned, but that's what weddings are about, right? END
BEGIN HERE Now let the pros handle it, and get back to cocktail hour! END
BEGIN HERE The goal of creating the perfect wedding can blind you to what is most important about the wedding day: your marriage! Heed the wisdom of these women who have been there as they share about their wedding planning regrets after having been through it all. END
BEGIN HERE "I wish I'd thought more about who we were as a couple — what we liked — to create a truly personal day, rather than trying to accommodate everyone's ideas of 'how it should be.'" —Tracy END
BEGIN HERE "We did a destination wedding. I wanted to wear a full-length wedding dress with some beading or lace details. I had it narrowed down to two dresses I liked equally, but I selected the one made of heavy satin. The other dress was lighter, more 'flowy,' and didn't wrinkle. I hadn't thought about how I would carry my dress on the plane and put it in an overhead bin. In hindsight, selecting the lighter dress that didn't wrinkle would have created less stress and been easier to steam. So — if you're doing a destination wedding, think through the details of what you'll need to carry with you on the plane before selecting a dress. This includes anything you wouldn't trust to baggage handlers, like shoes, jewelry, veil, dress, and tux." —Tiffani END
BEGIN HERE "DON'T go cheap on the photographers! You will have those for life, be sure it's EXACTLY what you are looking for!" —Elizabeth END
BEGIN HERE "Hire a Planner. It's not a luxury. A planner can save you tons of time and money by hooking you up with trusted vendors and helping you sidestep unexpected costs... And once you know you want a particular vendor, don't wait to book! Trusted and established vendors book up fast!" —Jennifer END
BEGIN HERE "I wish I'd brought a change of COMFORTABLE shoes. I was switching between two 5-inch pairs of shoes, which gave me some reprieve, but I was in a lot of pain for something you couldn't even see! I'm usually fine in heels but you are dressed very far in advance to the ceremony and reception, and I think my feet were tired from the rehearsal dinner as well." —Ashley END
BEGIN HERE "I wish I would have had better foresight when I signed contracts. My wedding was supposed to be the lead article in NY Times Sunday Styles section. This was a dream of mine and I was about to achieve it. The article was cancelled when my photographer informed me her contact said no other professionals were allowed to be present to photograph the wedding. The NY Times requires their own photographer to take the photos. My photographer wouldn't relent and essentially ruined my dream. My heart was broken, and I was completely upset about this a few days before my wedding. As if I didn't have enough to be stressed out about. I also wish I would have told my bridesmaids to check their alterations after receiving their dresses back from the tailor. One of my bridesmaids did not, and her dress was too long; she had to hem it herself at the last minute." —Amanda END
BEGIN HERE "I learned not to stress about all the details of bridal showers and bachelorette parties. You will enjoy those events as long as you have friends and family by your side. And, a little champagne helps, too!" —Michiel END
BEGIN HERE "In retrospect, I would have added a clause in my venue contract for no last minute changes without discussing/notifying us first. We'd planned our outdoor reception around the market lights hanging from the two trellises that framed our area. We contracted to have more lights added to create a specific ambiance. We had hanging candlelight added as well. The day of the wedding the new catering manager decided instead of replacing a few burnt out bulbs with the Market Lights he would cut them down and staple ice blue LED Christmas string lights. Moral of story: if you have an important element that is integral make sure you tell them — and have it written in your contract." —Lisa (www.unveiledwisdom.com) END
BEGIN HERE "While planning my wedding, I wanted the perfect stationery, the perfect shoes, and the perfect flower arrangements. It wasn't until a few months before the wedding that I realized that I was being unreasonable. The people we invited to celebrate our union and the memories we made on the wedding day were what would make that day 'perfect.' While I love the creativity we put into designing our wedding day, the thing I remember the most is the laughter, the joy and tears from that day. In the end, our wedding day was just beautiful." —Martini END
BEGIN HERE "My honest advice for brides? Follow your heart, and don't listen to the many opinions that will come your way. I let myself get talked into navy blue beach towels in all of our out-of-town guest totes, and they looked like hotel towels!" —Kate END

BEGIN HERE  American Crime Story: For fair-haired brides who want an edgy look without getting too dark, Sarah Paulson shows us a gorgeous option. Start by lining all the way around the eyes with a black kohl liner. Smudge it thoroughly under the lower lashes for added drama. Then use shades of brown, rose gold, and copper to create a smokey effect — with the lightest, most shimmery shade on the inner corners and getting darker and more matte as you blend toward the outer corner of the eyes. A swipe or two of mascara, and your ultra edgy eye is complete. Coral blush along the cheekbones and a glossy pink lip finish off the look. END

BEGIN HERE Oh, how we wish this was an April Fool's joke... Yesterday, the news broke that one of Hollywood's sweetest duos, Drew Barrymore and Will Kopelman, are divorcing after four years of marriage. After tying the knot back in 2012 in a charming backyard wedding and bringing their little family to four with the addition of two adorable daughters, we thought this was happily ever after for the seemingly-perfect pair. However, it looks like their love story has come to an end. END
BEGIN HERE "Sadly our family is separating legally, although we do not feel this takes away from us being a family," Barrymore and Kopelman shared with People in a joint public statement. "Divorce might make one feel like a failure, but eventually you start to find grace in the idea that life goes on." END
BEGIN HERE Although the reason for the split remains murky, multiple sources claim that the couple is "devastated" by the unfortunate turn of events. As are we! We can't bear to say goodbye to this former twosome just yet, so we're looking back on a few of our absolutely favorite moments of the too-short love story of Drew and Will. Excuse us if we get a little teary-eyed... END

BEGIN HERE If your hubby-to-be isn't a fan of flowers or you're looking to do a little something different when it comes to the groomsmen's boutonniere, the good news is you have options! You don't have to go the traditional route and pick out a mini-bouquet of flowers for the guys to wear on their jacket pocket; you can use different types of materials, gadgets, and even items to create a more outside-the-box look. Here are seven types of boutonniere alternatives to add a little personality and a unique spin to your groom and groomsmen's look on your wedding day. END
BEGIN HERE   You can skip the flowers and the traditional boutonniere look all-together and opt-in for pocket squares instead. This will be a more formal and simple look — and something that every groomsmen can pull off. END

BEGIN HERE Ahhh, the open bar. The groomsmen will joke that it's the real reason they're at your wedding, and your parents might wince at the cost (pro tip: see if the liquor distributor will buy back unopened bottles!), but it's a generous gesture that your guests will notice and appreciate. There's no money exchanging hands over the counter, but there are bartenders back there pouring glasses of wine and mixing those specialty cucumber margaritas! Should there be a tip jar on the bar so guests can thank their servers? Here's what our experts think. END
BEGIN HERE Tip jars are definitely not necessary, especially when you're offering an open bar. Most contracts include a service fee and gratuity, and if they don't, you and your groom should have a tip ready to share with the bartenders when the evening is over, so tips are totally covered. END
BEGIN HERE However, you might look at the people rattling cocktail shakers, straining Cosmos, and dropping perfect twists into Old Fashioneds and think that, in almost any other situation, they'd be getting a little something for the Tom Cruise-style show they're putting on. And while any good bartending company, hotel, or caterer would never let their own bartenders put out a tip jar, none will fight you if the bride or groom insist that they put one out. END
BEGIN HERE  6 Creative, Tasty Food Pairings for Cocktail Hour END
BEGIN HERE If you do choose to put a tip glass on the bar, you might want to stick a dollar or two into it so the other servers don't accidentally clear the glass. You should also let your planner, the catering manager, or the banquet manager know that you were the ones who put the glass there, just to make sure the bartenders don't get in trouble for going against company policy. Your guests might not have any cash with them, but if they do and their drink was particularly good, they might want to slip a dollar in there, too. END

One, that baby has without a doubt won the good gene jackpot. (A supermodel mom and rockstar dad? Come on now!)

Lakers hat and a tiny red bikini — with her mini baby bump in full view! "My two favorite Laker fans, " the Maroon 5 frontman captioned the pic. And just in case you couldn't figure out who that second Laker fan was, Levin added the baby, milk bottle, and basketball emojis for good measure. END

BEGIN HERE If you're ready to shack up before you say "I do," you may be getting an earful from friends or family members who think you should wait for marriage to move in together. "Tradition is strong," says April Masini, relationship expert and advice columnist. "Many people are still the first generation to live together and whenever you break tradition, you've got questions to answer and judgment to be passed." END
BEGIN HERE But there are serious advantages to bucking tradition and living together before you tie the knot. Here, our experts share five, so you can make the right decision for you. END
BEGIN HERE   Says Greer, "You have the opportunity to see what your sexual appetites are once you're together all the time. Once you live together, you're able to be sexually intimate every day, if you like." And if you don't want to get down every day, she says, it's good to learn that before you tie the knot. "You'll get to know each other's level of desire and find a balance in terms of frequency so you can both feel good about your sexual life together," Greer says. END
BEGIN HERE We love ourselves a good celebrity proposal. A mind-blowing engagement ring, a few over-the-top surprises, and a picture-perfect photo op never fail to make us smile and start counting down the months, weeks, days, until the star-studded wedding. Remember Kanye West's larger than life jumbotron proposal? Or how about when Jose Antonio Baston popped the question to Eva Longoria amongst the desert sand dunes in Dubai? Yup, we definitely love an epic engagement story, but there's one certain morning show host who feels a little differently about over-the-top proposals. Hoda Kotb recently divulged her ideal wedding proposal — and it's nowhere near as big as her personality! END
BEGIN HERE Hoda Kotb, co-host of NBC's Today, has been dating her sweetheart, financier Joel Schiffman, for three years now. And with Kotb declaring that "He's a guy that gives me butterflies again at 50-years-old," to People magazine, we're of course  already hearing wedding bells for the New York City duo. (It is what we do, after all!) And apparently, stunning sparklers and white dresses are on Kotb's mind as well, as she just shared her dream popped question scenario with E! News. END
BEGIN HERE So what would get the previously married talkshow host back into bridal mode? "I don't like bells and whistles and planes flying overhead and flash mobs," Kotb revealed. "I feel like there's certain things in life that are intimate and between two people." So getting down on one knee with Howard Stern looking on and the public listening in (à la Maria Menounos) probably wouldn't earn an "I do" from Kotb! "I like it more low-key." END

BEGIN HERE Once you return home from the honeymoon, your real life together starts. And it's not always a smooth adjustment — going from solo to permanently coupled. Here's some excellent advice from women who have successfully navigated that passage. END
BEGIN HERE "We were told in our pre-marital classes that some days we'd have to 'choose love'. You might not want to do the grocery shopping alone, but if your spouse is overwhelmed with work that week, it's best to choose love and help lighten his load. You might have arguments and hurt each other, but rather than dragging it out, you need to choose to love each other so you can apologize and forgive." —Bridgett END
BEGIN HERE "I've been married five years. We survived by scheduling regular date nights to remind ourselves not to let busy lives and pressure for a perfect marriage get in the way of us." —Mila END
BEGIN HERE "I have been married for 11 years and still remember the challenges we overcame during our first year. The greatest challenge was managing expectations. We both came into the marriage with preconceived notions about how things would work, and when we didn't immediately live up to each other's expectations, things went south — and fast. However, we kept at it and worked on improving our ability to actually communicate our expectations. When we put our egos aside, we found we were able to be the person our spouse needed to really enjoy each other and the marriage." —Latasha END
BEGIN HERE "We married in February, 2015. What helped enormously right from the beginning was making time to check in. We still do weekly check-ins just to see how things are going versus waiting for issues to pop up. We have a standing calendar invite, and we write an agenda throughout the week of things to cover when we have that time for a longer thoughtful discussion." —Michiel END
BEGIN HERE "I found a marriage mentor. A work colleague had been married for 15 years at the time, and she was still happy. She gave me 'real deal' advice, and I also interviewed three people who divorced after five years or less. I asked what they would do differently if they were granted a do-over." —Kanesha END
BEGIN HERE "We started having a lot of disagreements, and neither of us felt heard or understood. So we went to a marriage counselor for help learning how to communicate and not fall into dysfunctional patterns. We wanted to put in the work before we became too, well, wedded to bad habits." —Beth END
BEGIN HERE "We had to set boundaries with our families. This was made easier once we had a conversation that we were one another's priority, number one, and our parents had to understand we were now a unit." —Ellen END
BEGIN HERE "Don't sweat the small stuff. Tom never makes the bed in the morning, which drove me crazy until I decided tangled sheets were much less important than having a loving, kind, sexy man to share my life." —Amy END

BEGIN HERE We hate to break it to you, but no matter how many all-nighters you pull planning seating charts, processional order, music selection, and everything in between, chances are that come your wedding day, something is bound to go wrong. But no need to sweat it! Part of being a bride is learning to roll with the punches. All you can do is just hope that your big day blooper isn't as laugh-out-loud hilarious as these bridal blunders!

Embarrassing? Just a little. But hysterically funny? Definitely. END
BEGIN HERE Okay, so maybe the thought of having one these mishaps occur makes you shudder, but, hey, they sure make for a memorable wedding day! (Isn't that what every bride wants, after all?)

END
BEGIN HERE Could there be a Kardashian wedding in the works for 2016? Thanks to some insider info surrounding Hollywood's newest (and somewhat controversial) engaged couple, we wouldn't be surprised! "Chyna will have at least two dresses on her wedding, both statement pieces," a source told E! News. Sources also reveal that Tyga's ex-love (yep, it's a little complicated) even "has an idea on who she may want to design her dresses." END
BEGIN HERE Known for rocking a catalogue of eclectic hairstyles, the future Mrs. Angela Kardashian will also likely style her own wedding day hair in a classic 'do, even going as far to stick to her natural dark roots. The famous makeup artist will also resourcefully resort to her own line of beauty products from her personal makeup line, which includes lavish eyelashes and colorful lip-gloss. "Her makeup will be flawless and she will be using all her products," the source told E! News. Chyna, who confirmed that she would go by Angela Kardashian post-wedding (an ode to her real name Angela White and her newly gained Kardashian surname). The bride-to-be frequently posts Instagram snapshots of her vividly colored makeup line, and bold hair colors, including a range of bold swatches from her newest lip-glosses. END

He has been seeing a trainer, nutritionist and working out on his own," the source told E! News, adding, "Chyna has been helping him and been pushing him in a supportive way. She also works out with him, so it's a team effort. Rob loves seeing his clothes get big and looking back on the progress he made." END

BEGIN HERE While a big part of planning a wedding is creating a fantastic celebration for your guests, it can sometimes feel like you're playing travel agent instead of planning a party, especially when it comes to lodging. You want to ensure that guests are staying somewhere convenient to your venue, but can't possibly predict who will turn the weekend into a week-long vacation, and who will decide to splurge on that luxury hotel on the other side of town. So when you're making wedding plans, do you have to arrange for a room block for your guests? Here's what our experts have to say. END
BEGIN HERE While a room block isn't required, setting aside a block of rooms at a local hotel or two will help ensure that your guests have somewhere to stay — especially if you're getting married on a holiday weekend or during a busier time of the year in a popular destination. END
BEGIN HERE When you're looking for hotels to get a room block at, try to pick options that are convenient to your venue, as well as in a range of price points so that there are a few options for guests to choose from. Talk to your rep at the hotel about how much you would be expected to pay if the rooms aren't all booked, as well as if you can secure a discounted rate if you're reserving a large number of rooms. END
BEGIN HERE  Do You Really Need to Give Guests Welcome Bags at Your Wedding? END
BEGIN HERE Another option is to secure a discounted rate without reserving a block of rooms. This would mean that, with your wedding code or by mentioning your names, your guests can book hotel rooms at a rate lower than what is listed on the hotel's website, but that there won't be a guaranteed number of rooms reserved for your guests. This could be a good option if you have a small guest list or are having your wedding during the off-season, but if you're expecting the majority of your guests to book hotel rooms (and want to offer transportation to your venue from a central location, or additional wedding-related events), a room block is the way to go. END
BEGIN HERE When Jessica Simpson titled her debut album Sweet Kisses in 1999, she probably had no idea the album title would have such an impact on her marriage to Eric Johnson. But fast forward 15 years later, and the concept is still working for the singer. Because the way Simpson and her retired NFL player hubby keep the spark alive? Good ol' fashion kissing. END
BEGIN HERE "I think the secret to a beautiful, loving marriage is just making out!" Simpson told People. "Don't forget to kiss. It's more intimate sometimes for a lot of people and if you forget that, you forget why you fell in love in the first place. It always begins with a kiss." END
BEGIN HERE Simpson certainly seems to know what she's talking about when it comes to keeping things spicy in her marriage — she and Johnson can't get enough of each other, at least on social media. The parents of two are constantly fawning over each other, whether it's with a silly selfie or in a steamy tweet, the PDA is totally on display. END
BEGIN HERE The two lovebirds got married in 2014 after a four year engagement. The wedding was a total family affair with their daughter Maxwell (who was two at the time) serving as the flower girl and their son Ace (one year old at the time) acting as an adorable ring bearer. END
BEGIN HERE Simpson and her football pro husband tied the knot at San Ysidro Ranch in Montecido, California against a rose garden backdrop. The shoe designer worked a custom champagne-and-gold-multi-layer tulle Caroline Herrara wedding dress with a strapless neckline and a blue ribbon tucked away as her "something blue". END
BEGIN HERE "The whole dress is embroidered in gold and feels very regal," Herrera told People of her bridal gown at the time. A cathedral-length veil, Brian Atwood shoes, and Neil Lane jewelry made Simpson look like a total princess at her nuptials. END
BEGIN HERE "We are overwhelmed with complete happiness and love having made our eternal commitment," the newlyweds told People post-nuptials. Two years later it sounds like these two are still head over heels for each other. It has to be all those kisses! END
BEGIN HERE Despite meeting and sharing their first date during their sophomore year of college in January of 2009, Molly and Nathan didn't start dating until the following August. "We realized that we had something special, something that was built on friendship, but we couldn't have imagined how much our love would grow," says Molly. "After four and a half years of dating, six moves between us both, job changes, one broken nose, two family reunions, many romantic weekend trips, one sweet pup, and countless promises of forever along the way, we got engaged on December 29, 2014." END
BEGIN HERE Nate popped the question in Rockefeller Center, but the couple decided on a hometown wedding in Raleigh, North Carolina, and dreamed up a navy, white, and dusty shale celebration filled with gold accents. "My main vision was for us to not lose sight of the important meaning of our day," says the bride. "I wanted a day full of love surrounded by our family and friends." With the help of their mothers, Molly and Nate's July 17, 2015, wedding went off without a hitch, and Oliva Wolf of Nancy Ray Photography was there to capture every last second. END

"We really didn't start any planning until April, but did most of in May, June, and July," says Molly.

BEGIN HERE One task Molly did tick off her to-do list early was finding the dress. A friend had told Molly about a Brides Against Breast Cancer Event in February 2015. At these events, brides-to-be can purchase designer gowns at a discount, with a portion of proceedings benefitting families affected by breast cancer. "I'm always looking for a good deal and I loved the idea of helping a good cause at the same time," Molly says. With her mother and sisters in tow, Molly tried on around 15 dresses, but it was a Matthew Christopher gown that another bride had on her rack that really caught her eye. END
BEGIN HERE The strapless silk trumpet gown was nearly perfect, but Molly kept going back and forth about whether or not she wanted a lace topper.

BEGIN HERE : Brides who love the fresh-faced look, but want a slightly more formal version, should take their cues from Anna Kendrick. Begin with a luminous-finish foundation, and then make the focus the eyes. Line the upper lashline, and just around the outer corners of the bottom, and smudge the line. On the upper lid, create a slight flick with the liner where the lashes curl to play them up  without falsies, then apply several coats of mascara. Next grab a palette of shimmery neutrals and use the darker shades in the crease and the very lightest along the bottom lashline and in the inner corners of the eyes. The final effect is a formal look that is still perfectly youthful and fresh. END

And after the two grooms said their vows and "I do's," the fiesta really began! Wu, his brand-new-hubby, and their ultra-fashionable guests took over the trendy Mexican town with a series of beachside parties that featured piñatas, tacos, and tequila.

BEGIN HERE We've all heard the harrowing statistics that couples argue more over money than anything else. And with a wedding presumably the biggest expense you've paid for together to-date, you're bound to have a bickering match or two. But luckily, our experts are here with tips to help you create and stick to your wedding budget fight-free. END
BEGIN HERE   One way to ensure you don't set yourself up for a financial fight later is to avoid taking out loans to pay for your wedding. "Sure, you might avoid a short-term argument by overstretching your budget now, but you're setting yourself up for major long-term problems in the future," Kaplan says. "Debt can easily snowball thanks to the high interest rates on credit cards, especially when you add in the costs of a honeymoon, moving in together, and other marriage-related expenses." END

BEGIN HERE No matter what kind of wedding you're planning — big, small, backyard, big city — there's one thing nearly every couple wants included in their day: Personalization! At the end of the wedding, every bride and groom wants their friends and family to go home thinking, "That was so them!" And that's exactly why we can't get enough of Giselle and Peter's outdoor wedding at Os Agostos in Loulé, Portugal, which highlighted exactly what this adorable twosome is all about. Happy Together Films joined this happy couple and captured every special memory from their breathtaking celebration. END
BEGIN HERE First and foremost: How pretty is this couple's European backdrop? They took advantage of everything from bustling city streets to lush, private landscapes, and the result was nothing short of stunning. And speaking of stunning, let's talk about the blushing bride. Her incredible long-sleeved embroidered gown was a site to behold. The delicate detailing on the bodice and skirt was perfectly balanced by the gown's high neckline. With loose curls, a super-sweet flower crown, and a fresh makeup look, she's every bit the picture of a blushing bride. But on top of being a natural beauty, this bride was expecting a baby with her groom and still pulled off an insanely gorgeous (and flawless!) wedding day look. END

BEGIN HERE Writing your own vows can be both freeing and paralyzing: Because while you're free to write from the heart, you can be paralyzed with fear your vows won't stack up to those of your new spouse. Plus, what if you leave something out and look like a fool in front of your friends and family? END
BEGIN HERE But you can focus only on the amazing opportunity in front of you, because we've got expert advice on exactly what to include, so that your vows will wow both your spouse and your guests. END
BEGIN HERE "Having couples write their own vows allows them to really think about what's important, and to think about how they would act and react in their marriage," says Monique Honaman, wedding officiant and author of The High Road Has Less Traffic. Honaman advises her couples start with a standard vow template and go from there, sure to include these three very important sentiments in what they write themselves. END
BEGIN HERE   You've gathered your friends and family to celebrate your wedding, but the truth is, you'll need them just as much during your marriage. So, Honaman recommends you "use your vows to acknowledge that you need others to help your marriage be successful," she says. "This may mean acknowledging the role of religion or God in making your marriage work, or the role of family and friends who will help support you when times get tough. I believe it's helpful to know the two of you aren't in this alone." END
BEGIN HERE It goes without saying that the bride should have all eyes on her on her wedding day. But, she also wants her mother to feel elegant and beautiful for the wedding. While mothers of the bride have many different tastes and preferences, some prefer a more modern, fashion-forward spin on their wedding day ensembles. Thankfully, for mothers of the bride and groom in the Bay Area, there are plenty of contemporary shopping destinations where she can find the perfect dress to celebrate the wedding in supreme style.

BEGIN HERE If you've decided to invite children to your wedding, you'll likely have some adorable little guests running around in tiny suits and dresses — what could be cuter? However, you'll also have younger guests who may not want to sit through dinner, and could lose patience halfway through your reception. A great way to keep the kids entertained — without their parents having to ditch the party at 8:30 — is to offer on-site babysitters to look after them while their parents are enjoying dinner or on the dance floor with you. Beyond hiring babysitters, do you need to set up activities for the kids? Here's what our experts think. END
BEGIN HERE While it's not a necessity, putting together a selection of activities for your youngest guests to do during your reception is a thoughtful touch. Consider arming the babysitters with coloring books and crayons, games that appeal to a few different age groups, books, and a Disney movie or two so they can make sure everyone from your two-year-old flower girl to your ten-year-old niece has something to do. Keep in mind that most venues won't have items like this on-hand, so even if you're not putting together a whole evening of fun, you'll want to bring in some craft supplies and games for the kids to play with. END
BEGIN HERE Consider wedding-related activities, like an I Spy game that will have kids keeping an eye out for a woman in a red dress, your cake cutting, or the first dance. If your venue has an outdoor space, a cornhole set or lawn bowling would be fun for children and adults alike. If you don't have a separate space where the babysitters can keep an eye on the kids, set up a kids' table at one end of the room, and top it with little gift bags full of no-mess activities for them to play with while their parents are partying. END
BEGIN HERE If we weren't already excitedly anticipating the upcoming nupitals between Ciara and Russell Wilson (don't worry, we were...), we definitely are now. After the Seattle Seahawks quarterback popped the question to the sultry singer last month, we've been patiently — okay, maybe not so patiently — waiting to see how their big day will start to shape up. Well, the wait is over! The engaged duo just gave us a bridal preview after teasing us with photos of themselves attending a friend's wedding, looking like a picture-perfect bride and groom! END
BEGIN HERE We've all seen Ciara in a wedding dress before (she was a former BRIDES covergirl, after all!) and we know the girl glows all decked out in lace and tulle. So after Ciara and Wilson shared their engagement news in a selfie-style "She said yes!" video back in March, we've been aching to see the singer back in bridalwear. That day came sooner than we thought when the couple posted a few formally-dressed Instagram videos over the weekend. "We're getting eloped!" the football star blurted out to the camera, dressed to the nines in a sleek wedding tux. END
BEGIN HERE  Our Favorite Celebrity Engagement Rings END
BEGIN HERE Luckily, it was just a fake-out, as the to-be-wed pair were actually headed to a friend's big day. But Russell did manage to get us going for a second with his elopement joke! (If they were hopping onto the secret celebrity wedding bandwagon, we'd never be able to forgive them...) But once our heart rates returned to normal, we couldn't help but get excited over their flawless wedding wear. Wilson's dashing tux and Ciara's long wedding-ready locks and bridal beauty look are just as fitting for a walk down the aisle, as they were for witnessing someone else's "I do's." END
BEGIN HERE Let's just hope the next "I do's" said are theirs! END
BEGIN HERE We love a good surprise engagement story. The elaborate proposal plans, the happy tears, the occasional bit of shocked profanity... We can't get enough! But there's surprising a to-be-bride with a "Will you marry me?" and a sparkly engagement ring, and then there's giving her a mild heart attack. This is definitely an example of the latter. A Louisiana man pulled off quite the shocking popped question scenario, that started with a staged robbery and ended with a just as jaw-dropping diamond ring! END
BEGIN HERE Amanda Wheatley just thought she was going on a romantic dinner date with her sweetheart, Taylor Myers, according to KLFY News. But her beau had something else up his sleeve — a special sparkler, in fact, and a slightly terrifying proposal plan... END
BEGIN HERE As the pair walked to a restaurant, Myers arranged to have a group of men approach them, setting the plan into motion. "What you got in your pocket?" one of the men asked the couple, as if they were about to rob them. Cue Wheatley's heart attack. END
BEGIN HERE When a police officer entered the scene (don't worry, he was in on the act), the "robbers" flipped the script, telling the officer that Myers was the one starting the trouble, resulting in him forcing Myers to his knees and handcuffing him as his poor, scared girlfriend frantically tried to resolve the situation. END
BEGIN HERE That's when the robbers-turned-quartet began crooning. "Look at me I'm on my knees 'cause I want to marry you. Marry you. Everything I'll ever need is right here in front me, too. Talkin' 'bout you, " they sang. Cue Wheatley's second heart attack of the day. END
BEGIN HERE  Our Favorite Celebrity Engagement Rings END
BEGIN HERE Still on his knees, Myers pulled out the ring and asked his still-shaking love those four little words. Despite her now-fiancé almost scaring her half to death, Wheatley immediately accepted her beau's proposal. END
BEGIN HERE While the result of this to-be-groom's over-the-top proposal was as hilarious as it was heartwarming, let's just hope this happy prankster pair doesn't pull the fire alarm or stage a murder at their own wedding... END
BEGIN HERE After the appetizers have been passed around at cocktail hour and your wedding guests have devoured the entrees during the reception, the greatest way to end the night is with dessert. By the end of your wedding, your guests will likely have sweated off the food they ate and start to get hungry for a late night treat. If you're looking to have a traditional cake with a twist or want to just skip the cake altogether, here are four ideas for a dessert bar on your wedding day. END
BEGIN HERE   If you're a doughnut person, you can create a doughnut bar with toppings that your guests can put on different flavored doughnuts. Include doughnuts of all different sizes and icings — and even get creative with the shapes. END

BEGIN HERE Offering transportation to and from your wedding venue is a great way to make sure guests get where they need to be on-time and feel free to enjoy the party. The most important step (after booking the shuttles, of course) is letting your guests know when and where to get on the shuttles, both at their hotel and at your venue at the end of the night. What is the best way to let guests know about the shuttle schedule? Our experts have a few ideas. END
BEGIN HERE The first place to put the shuttle schedule is on your wedding website. Specify when the shuttles will start running, in what increments of time, and from where. Be sure to schedule in enough time so that shuttles can make multiple trips if needed, while still ensuring that guests on the last shuttle will get to your ceremony before it begins, as well as starting the shuttles home at the end of the evening early enough that older guests or those with children can get home at a reasonable hour. END
BEGIN HERE You can also put together an information packet to share with your guests when they check in to the hotel. Tuck the schedule into your welcome bags, or add it to a welcome note to be distributed to guests as they arrive. END
BEGIN HERE  The Deal on Providing Transportation for Your Bridal Party END
BEGIN HERE When it comes to shuttles home at the end of the night, you might want to put a small sign by the entrance to the reception and on the bar that lets guests know when the first shuttle will leave, how frequently they'll be running, and what time the last shuttle will depart. Try something short and sweet, like "Ready to call it a night? Shuttles back to the hotel will depart every 45 minutes, starting at 9:30 pm. The last shuttle leaves at 12:30pm." END
BEGIN HERE If the late-night shuttles are going to more than one place, be sure to have a sign in the window of each shuttle stating where it's going so that no one ends up at the wrong hotel! END
BEGIN HERE We love looking back at where our favorite celebrity love stories got their start. And Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones' happily-ever-after is one of Hollywood's greats. With a successful 15-year marriage under their belts, their super sweet, almost two-decades-long love story is certainly nothing to shake a stick at. But where did it all start? Well, it turns out that these silver screen legends like to tease their two children with that exact story! END
BEGIN HERE Before the movie star duo tied the knot in a glitzy Plaza Hotel wedding and Catherine Zeta Jones wowed the world with her legendary, Christian Lacroix six-figure wedding dress (it cost a whopping $140,000, to be exact!), Michael Douglas had to pop the question. It's been 16 years since the A-list actor got down on one knee, whisking his bride off to the Rocky Mountains to propose. And the still head-over-heels couple recently took the entire clan back to their exact proposal spot for a little romantic reminiscing. "It was great!" Douglas told People magazine of his family's trip. "We went back to Aspen, Colorado where I did propose to Catherine, New Years Eve 1999, so I would never forget it. It's very easy to remember." Not a bad plan, we must say! END
BEGIN HERE While the happily-wedded couple couldn't have been more excited to return to their proposal spot and the house in which they stayed in all those years ago — with Catherine even posting a photo of the romantic locale to Instagram — their teenage children were a little less excited about their parents recalling those ooey-gooey memories! END
BEGIN HERE  Our Favorite Celebrity Engagement Rings END
BEGIN HERE "We went to the house where I was," Douglas explained. "They let us in and everything else. I showed them where the chair was and they were like 'Ew, this is gross!'" END
BEGIN HERE Well, at least we think it's cute, Douglas! END
BEGIN HERE While it's true that most wedding gowns go all the way down to the floor and bridal legs are rarely exposed, that's no excuse for less than smooth legs (or, ahem, other areas as well). Whether you're dreaming of glistening, pristine honeymoon legs, eyebrows on fleek (is "fleek" even still a thing?) or you have other, more intimate hair removal goals — there are a few golden rules for seamless pre-wedding hair removal. END
BEGIN HERE   Avoid getting layered, tweezed, waxed, threaded, etc. the week before your menstrual cycle. Science and biology prove that during this time, hair follicles can swell and become more inflamed than usual, and redness can stick around longer. Specifically, fluctuating hormones also often result in increased sensitivity to pain and irritation. While hair removal isn't typically a walk in the park, going during this peak time can make it extra unpleasant, and who needs that? END
BEGIN HERE When your wedding guest list looks similar to the one for a star-studded red carpet, you know it's going to be an epic night! For celebrity stylist, Jamie Schneider, and her hedge fund manager groom, Nico Mizrahi, their Aspen wedding was nothing short of award-winning. The lavish couple, and their group of celebrity BFFs, took to social media to share some (mainly goofy) highlights from one of the year's most memorable "I dos!" END
BEGIN HERE What's the only thing better then two celebrities walking down the aisle? A bunch of A-list stars attending the same star-studded wedding in Colorado! (For us at least.) Thanks to the clever use of geotags in Snapchat — a personalized way to add the "where and when" to your snapped photo — the guests of the Schneider-Mizrahi Colorado wedding ceremony got to share their hilarious wedding photos with the world. For stars like Jessica Alba and Kate Hudson, Snapchat was the perfect way to chronicle the ceremony from beginning to end. "The Honest Company" founder took to the popular social media channel to share a hilarious couple's picture of two of Hollywood's most popular BFFs, pop-superstar, Katy Perry, and fashion guru, Derek Blasberg (see in the above video). Alba also posted a goofy group shot of her and bestie, Nicole Richie, which perfectly embraced the light-hearted mood of the evening, as well as another group photo posing in front of Aspen's stunning natural backdrop with the caption, "Wedding time!" END
BEGIN HERE The iconic How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days actress also joined in on the Snapchat fun by posting a catalogue of funny images, like one of her doting brother, Oliver Hudson, and a photo posted long after the crack of dawn with the caption, "I'm going to bed...cause I have a feeling I'll be making their kids breakfast," People reports. END
BEGIN HERE The A-list stars managed to cover all aspects of the lavish nuptials with Alba posting videos from the reception, including the milestone moment of the just-married-twosome cutting into their cake, Daily News reports. END
BEGIN HERE But those weren't the only red carpet regulars who successfully captured moments from the star-studded wedding! Richie took to Instagram to post a hilarious group video of her and the night's many fabulous guests. The hilarious House of Harlow founder even commented on the popular use of social media in her hilariously honest caption writing, "I'll have a wedding with a side of snapchat, tequila, & altitude delirium please." END
BEGIN HERE Other celebs involved in the star-studded headcount included Cameron Diaz, a newly engaged, Dianna Agron, fashion stylist Rachel Zoe, and newly paired couple Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom, who were seen shopping in Aspen the day before the wedding. "They walked with their arms linked up and she rested her head on his shoulder," said an insider to the Daily Mail in reference to Hollywood's newest pair's not-so-hidden agenda. "They were very natural and low key. Nobody even noticed them as they strolled along." END

BEGIN HERE Whether you moved for school, work, or love, planning a wedding far from the people you care about can be tough, especially if you have friends and family scattered across the country. It can get extra hard when it comes to all the little events surrounding your wedding, like bridal showers and bachelorette parties. Sure, it's normal to ask people to travel for your wedding day, but asking them to make multiple trips for multiple events can feel like you're asking too much. If your long distance relationship isn't with your fiancé, but rather with your friends, we've got a few ideas for bridging that miles-wide gap. END
BEGIN HERE   If you grew up down South, went to college in Chicago, and now call Boston home, you've probably got pockets of friends all over the place. It might not be feasible for your friends to get together from across the country, so instead, consider having a few separate showers or engagement parties with each group. We love the idea of a more formal bridal shower at home, hosted by your mom or sister, an engagement party-meets-couples shower in your new hometown with your fiancé and the whole gang, and a destination bachelorette weekend somewhere easily accessible for both your childhood and college besties. Sure, it's a lot of flying, but it will give you a chance to celebrate with everyone you love — not to mention a few more opportunities for a glass of champagne! END

We turned to astrologer Danielle Mercurio to get a little guidance and find out exactly what the stars have in store for you and your planning. END
BEGIN HERE   This week may find you and your fiancé more aligned and in love than ever! You seem to be attached at the hip lately and it's been fun having someone to stroll through the wedding registry aisles with and flip through sample invitations. You trust more than ever that you and your partner are a team and are even more excited for all that's in store on your wedding journey! END
BEGIN HERE The secret to a happy, healthy marriage? Sharing tons of side-splitting laughter with your spouse! That's pretty much a no-brainer, right? Well, Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively are certainly putting that little love lesson to good use — in the bedroom! Reynolds was honored with the Best Comedic Performance award at the MTV Movie Awards over the weekend and his on-stage shout out to his wife proved just what a funny guy he is...in bed! END
BEGIN HERE The Deadpool star got audiences laughing with his turn as the profanity-spewing superhero, but apparently he's a pro at getting his beautiful bride giggling, as well. After snagging the award for his wisecracking role, Reynolds took the MTV stage and got a little naughty with his acceptance speech. END
BEGIN HERE "I have been trying to get Deadpool made for over a decade and I failed and it's you the fans that got this made," Reynolds began. "The reason I'm standing up here is because of you guys." Okay, pretty normal so far, right? But things took a raunchy (and hilarious!) turn when the action star took a moment to thank a very special someone. "I want to thank my wife," Reynolds sweetly said. "Everything I do is to make her laugh — especially the sex. So, thank you." Too funny!

BEGIN HERE The moment that engagement ring slides onto your finger, you'll find yourself beaming with joy and radiating with pure and utter excitement over the beauty of your newest, and perhaps even, your most expensive piece of jewelry. Your engagement ring should be timeless and something you may decide to wear everyday for the rest of your life. Or it may be something you wear only on special occasions and store away in a safe place the rest of the time. Either way, making sure your ring is insured is something to add to your post-engagement to-do list. Before you start shopping for the right engagement ring insurance plan, here are four things you should know. END

"That was my first job, where I met her. She was the star I had this major crush on her. Everyone did," he revealed to Ellen DeGeneres on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in February. "The whole crew had a crush on her and I was so embarrassed that I didn't talk to her for about a week." How cute is it imagining Wolverine being too nervous to talk to a pretty girl?

BEGIN HERE At once cosmopolitan, historic and effortlessly chic, Paris remains an unparalleled destination for romance — and honeymoons! The key to planning a mini honeymoon in the City of Light — whether it's your first visit or your fifth — is to not try to do it all. Instead, create a list of "must sees" together with your fiancé. Plan on getting to a couple of sites each day, but also take time for the small stuff: appreciating the views from your Parisian flat; lingering over un café au lait at a sidewalk cafe; strolling arm-in-arm on the Seine, and through the city streets, soaking it all in. Before you know it, Paris will have you swooning. END
BEGIN HERE   There are an infinite number of ways to experience Paris. For a more intimate encounter, consider adding one of the city's smaller museums to your itinerary. The Picasso, Rodin or Gustave Moreau museums feature masterworks in elegant settings that are inevitably less crowded. END

BEGIN HERE While bridal showers used to be an opportunity for female relatives and friends to help a bride get ready for married life, these days showers have gotten a little more, er, fun. Activities like cooking classes are often added to the schedule, as are more traditional games like making wedding dresses out of toilet paper or Bride and Groom trivia. Some couples really buck tradition with a co-ed shower taking the place of the bridal shower. With the groom and his friends added to the mix, what should be on the schedule? Our experts have a few ideas. END
BEGIN HERE Couples' showers are a great opportunity to put a fun and modern twist on the traditional bridal shower. Instead of an all-out girly event, pick a theme that the bride and groom will both really love, whether that means fancy cocktails at the couple's favorite bar or taco night at home. Swap champagne brunch with a wine tasting (complete with delicious pairings), and trade afternoon tea for a backyard barbecue with lawn games and beers. END
BEGIN HERE When it comes to activities, choosing a theme with built-in things to do is a great place to start. You can also include crowd-friendly entertainment like The Newlywed Game, with the couple seeing who knows the other person best, or bingo while you're opening gifts. Split guests up into teams for trivia and see which of your friends knows the most about your relationship. Be sure to have a few fun prizes to keep things competitive! END

The host could also encourage your guests to bring something off-registry that matches, such as turning a wine tasting shower into a cellar-building opportunity and asking guests to bring their favorite bottles of wine.

BEGIN HERE A few years back, a canceled trip to Mexico caused Sara and Shant to trade the beach for a stay-cation at their favorite spot in downtown New York, the Greenwich Hotel. "It was one of the most amazingly memorable weekends," says Sara, the owner of Deux Lux handbags. So in December of 2013, when Sara came back from a 10-day work trip in Asia, Shant decided to surprise her with another weekend at their favorite spot. "We had dinner at Locanda Verde, and were reminiscing about our stay at the Greenwich Hotel," says Sara. "I said we should do it again soon, and Shant pulled a room key out of his pocket and said 'Why not tonight?'!" She still hadn't caught on to his plan, but it all came together when she walked into their suite and found their chocolate lab, Dylan, sitting on the couch. "He ran over to me, and I saw something dangling on his collar. It was a beautiful ring and a silver dog tag that read 'Will You Marry Me?'" she remembers. END
BEGIN HERE Inspired by yet another favorite vacation, Sara and Shant only looked at one venue for their wedding: The Resort at Pelican Hill, on the Newport coast in California. "There was no question about getting married anywhere else," says Sara. The pair planned a two-day celebration on December 19 and 20, 2014, with a Persian ceremony on Friday and a Christian ceremony on Saturday, and invited 170 guests to join them. Scout Designs and So Happi Together helped them create a decidedly chic weekend (with two totally different color schemes!).

Each table featured a lush centerpiece of peonies, roses, ranunculus, anemones, and greenery. Guests sipped pomegranate and prosecco sparklers and ate crostini topped with ricotta and honey before settling in for a meal of crispy rice and beef stew.

BEGIN HERE Newlywed Jaclyn Ying probably won't be framing these portraits and hanging them in her house anytime soon, but she is sharing her wedding pictures online as a cautionary tale to other couples. According to the bride's lengthy Facebook post, Ying had hired the services of a photographer from a "pretty reputable bridal shop" in Singapore, but wasn't given the choice of a photographer. Instead, the bride was promised that the "standard of the talent pool was consistent," and therefore was shown a customary set of photographs formerly taken by the company. While Ying and her now-husband were initially skeptical, they went ahead with the vendor, happy to cross another thing off their list of wedding to-dos. END
BEGIN HERE After finally taking a peek at their wedding photos, the couple was shocked to find that every snapshot brought them to tears (and not the happy kind!). "I was in disbelief. I cried too. A lot," Ying told The Straits Times about the heartbreaking incident. But instead of keeping the mishap to herself, the bride shared the snapshots with Facebook, and her post has now been shared more than 13,000 times. "So, what do you do when you finally receive your actual wedding day photos and find yourself sorely disappointed in them? Get angry? Check. Shed a few tears over them? Done," the bride wrote. END

Not exactly a photo you want to look back on to remember all of the amazing highlights of the most important day of your life. "I had expected that the photos would roughly fall within what we wanted — not blurred, well lit, reasonably well edited," said Ying. END

BEGIN HERE Even though the frustration behind the photos was the main source of fuel for the cautionary Facebook post, the newlywed's emphasized that the post was not meant to "flame-and-shame" the bridal shop or the photographer, Mashable confirms. By sharing her story, Ying further wanted to elaborate on "the industry practice of not letting wedding package couples choose their photographer based on their specific portfolio." The couple is currently in the process of discussing compensation with the bridal shop for their big day mishap. END

BEGIN HERE Traditionally, weddings and the months leading up to them are bursting with generosity. There are engagement parties and bridal showers. People spend hundreds on plane tickets and bedding sets. Friends and family members offer their time, support, and energy. So, in this time of great giving, what better time to give back? Whether you make a donation to a cause in place of party favors or ask your guests to invest in a charity instead of a crock pot, a little selflessness can go a long way for many non-profits — and experts say the practice is becoming more and more popular for engaged couples. END
BEGIN HERE Choosing which organization will be gifted with your support can be overwhelming — with so many worthy causes to choose from, but you can't go wrong choosing something personal to you and your fiancé. Did either of you lose a family member to a particular disease? Contribute to groups fighting to find a cure. Love animals? Donate to a local shelter. Whatever you pick, know that you're making a difference by paying all that wedding generosity forward. END

BEGIN HERE Few people like to talk about money. But couples who can honestly communicate about their finances before they get married will be in better shape for the future, says Elle Kaplan, finance expert and founder of LexION Capital. END
BEGIN HERE "Almost every one of your relationship milestones is connected to finances, yet money is often seen as a taboo subject to bring up, even when you're tying the knot," she says. "That's why I tell couples to start talking about their finances as soon as a relationship turns serious. If both partners start discussing money early, they can work together and make compromises to take their relationship to a whole new level." END
BEGIN HERE To get you started, here are six money questions you must ask before you say "I do." END
BEGIN HERE   Many couples take for granted that after they tie the knot, they'll simply share everything from bank accounts to credit cards. But that may not be the right move for you. "While marriage is indeed a union, your finances aren't going to automatically be combined into one account after saying 'I do,'" she says. "It's important to discuss whether you'll merge your finances into a joint account, or maintain individual accounts. What works for many partners is to have a joint account for large financial spending, and individual accounts for day-to-day spending. Either way, you'll want to set up a system where there's financial transparency, especially for larger purchases." END
BEGIN HERE Your list of wedding stationery needs doesn't end when the invitations are sent out and the RSVP cards are received. Not only are there additional wedding stationery items you'll want to include in your big day's design and décor, you'll want to have some of those mailed items with you for your photographer to document, too! But with so many pieces coming together over the course of your planning process, what do you really need to bring on your wedding day? Let us break it down for you. END
BEGIN HERE   No, not for guests — for your vendors! You should have all the tips assembled before your wedding day, but if there's a vendor you forgot, having your checkbook and a thank you card means you can jot down a note and write a check, then pass it off to the vendor in question like you'd had it with you all along. END

We already knew they were great at quieting toddler tantrums, but who knew that the children's musical group your nieces and nephews listened to incessantly would eventually make for such beautiful bridal inspiration? Two members of the friendly foursome — the yellow and purple Wiggles, to be exact — tied the knot over the weekend and it was even cuter than all their sing-along songs. END
BEGIN HERE We never would've guessed that the yellow and purple Wiggles, Emma Watkins and Lachy Gillespie, were head-over-heels in love! The first ever Wiggles wedding took place in the group's home country of Australia in front of 200 guests, according to The Daily Mail. The bride exchanged her iconic sunny-hued Wiggles uniform for a breathtaking wedding dress, featuring a high neckline, an embellished lace bodice and long sleeves. She topped off her trademark red locks with a glitzy headpiece by Viktoria Novak. The luxe look probably wasn't suited for much wiggling about, but it was so impossibly pretty, and the groom seems to agree! END
BEGIN HERE "Seeing Emma was the most magical moment of my life. Everything else just seemed to melt away," Gillespie sweetly said. Later at the reception, things got even sweeter when Gillespie performed a song for his bride. A tear-jerking talker and a smooth singer? Help! We're in love with a Wiggle! Too bad he's officially off the market... END
BEGIN HERE Of course the rest of the gang, Anthony Field and Simon Pryce, were in attendance and even the original members of the group, Murray Cook and Jeff Fatt, came to watch Emma and Lacy exchange their vows — and a pair of wedding bands with Emma's signature Wiggles bow engraved on them! END

BEGIN HERE As Jane Greer, Ph.D., relationship expert and author of What About Me? Stop Selfishness From Ruining Your Relationship, puts it, having sex with the same person over and over again is a lot like playing the same song on repeat: You may love it at first, but with each time you do (or hear) it again, it gets a little less exciting. "Eventually, you'll want to play it less and less often," she says. END
BEGIN HERE But a stale sex life is, unfortunately, normal. "It's not uncommon for married couples who have been together for several years to find that their sexual desire and passion seem to peter out from a strong fire to smoldering ashes," says Madeleine Castellanos, M.D., sex expert and author of Wanting to Want: What Kills Your Sex Life and How to Keep It Alive. But it doesn't have to stay that way. Here, our experts give you nine tips to get that fire going again (or never lose it in the first place). END
BEGIN HERE   "So many couples incorrectly assume that they can perfectly read each other's signals when it comes to letting each other know they'd like to get frisky," says Castellanos. Instead, "it's best to have a playful conversation at a neutral time and ask each other how they best like to be asked for sex. You may be surprised at what you find at this simple way of opening up the lines of communication." END

BEGIN HERE It might sound like a formality before the rehearsal dinner and welcome party get started, but a wedding ceremony rehearsal is actually pretty important. After all, practice makes perfect! A run-through with your wedding party and officiant will ensure everyone knows when to walk, where to stand, and what to say throughout your ceremony. In the name of being totally prepared for your big moment, who actually needs to be at your rehearsal? Our experts break it down. END
BEGIN HERE The most important people to have at your ceremony rehearsal are anyone who will be participating in some way, whether it's walking down the aisle or doing a reading. Of course the bride, groom, parents, and officiant need to be present (since you've all got starring roles!). You don't necessarily need to go through your vows line-by-line, but reviewing the general order of things — like whether the handfasting is before or after your cousin reads an excerpt from The Little Prince — will help ensure that everyone knows when their part is coming up. END
BEGIN HERE You also want as much of your wedding party there as possible. If one or two members are on later flights or don't get in until the morning of your wedding, that's fine, but you want the majority of your bridesmaids and groomsmen there to practice the processional and recessional so they can fill in anyone else. Do you have little ones participating, as well? The rehearsal is the perfect time to familiarize them with what they'll be doing, as well as to help them get more comfortable in a new space. Show them exactly where Mom and Dad will be sitting and where they should go when they're done walking down the aisle so it won't be too scary or new the next day. END

BEGIN HERE Make sure that all of your readers are present, too. Again, they don't need to read every line of what they'll be sharing on your wedding day, but knowing what happens before they're supposed to speak will give them a good cue to look for once the real deal is underway. END
BEGIN HERE Try not to have too many extra people around so that the rehearsal can run smoothly and quickly, without distractions. They'll get to see your ceremony IRL soon enough! END
BEGIN HERE If you and your groom love all things spicy, then why not give everyone miniature bottles of your favorite hot sauces as edible wedding favors? Embellish the bottles with a thank-you favor tag, or have them perform double-duty as escort cards (simply tie an escort-card around the bottle's neck).

For her latest BRIDES column, Jen is here to give some expert advice to wedding guests who are wondering what to do with leftover food. END
BEGIN HERE Weddings make people hungry. That's because the ceremony is usually smack down in the middle of most people's dinner time, and once the couple has exchanged their vows, and sealed the deal with a smooch, people's stomachs are making all kinds of noise. END
BEGIN HERE By cocktail hour, tiny plates are stacked up with hors d'oeuvre and wedding guests are looking to snag seconds on the mini lobster tacos, or the spicy tuna cones (Yum!). So when it comes time to the reception's three-course meal, guests may already find themselves full. Leading some wedding guests to ask: can I take this food home with me? They will take a bite or two and want to bring the rest home for dinner tomorrow night. Is it okay to ask a server for a box to take it home or should they let it go to waste? END
BEGIN HERE In the end, the couple did spend quite a bit of money per person on the food. If people don't take advantage of the meal in front of them, it's kind of a waste, right? END
BEGIN HERE It's okay to ask the waiter or the server for a bag or a box to take your meal home with you, but try not to make it noticeable to the other guests or even the bride and the groom. If the couple sees their guests boxing up food, they may start to get worried and wonder why nobody there is hungry. Instead, ask the staff to box up your meal in the kitchen and have them bring it out to you toward the end of the night when the other guests and the bride and groom are out on the dance floor. END
BEGIN HERE Know that it is okay to do this, but not okay to make a scene about it. END
BEGIN HERE Can you really register for a mortgage? Send digital wedding invites? Say no to a bridal shower? Many of the old wedding rules have gone the way of the dowry. No longer is Emily Post dictating every step of your journey to the altar. In fact, engaged gals around the country are re-writing the rule book when it comes to nuptial protocol, so we're here to give you the low-down on the wedding world's new etiquette guide on every aspect of your big day.

BEGIN HERE You love your bridesmaids. In fact, their different tastes, styles, and personalities make you love them even more — but when it comes to getting everyone to shimmy into the same dress, drama can definitely ensue. END
BEGIN HERE Luckily, you live in NYC, where there's a slew of stylish bridesmaid dresses to suit every style and budget. So your only real issue is reeling everyone into a dress you love (and let's face it), one they won't gawk over. END
BEGIN HERE We sat down with Claudia Hanlin, owner of The Wedding Library, to help decode the best dresses for every bridesmaid scenario under the sun. Here are Claudia's top tips to help each of your girls feel beautiful on your big day! END
BEGIN HERE   ![UPDATED Find Local Vendors Button](http://www.brides.com/wedding-vendors) END
BEGIN HERE When you first get engaged, you'll find yourself almost suffocated with a wave of happiness and excitement. You'll be saying yes to more than just a dress: wedding vendors, a venue, and even special requests from immediate family members, before having the chance to take a deep breath. But the best thing you can do, before making any wedding plans, is to set a budget for your wedding. That way, you'll limit overspending early, and you'll know exactly what you can afford when contacting and deciding on vendors. END
BEGIN HERE So when creating a budget for your wedding, your first question will naturally be: How much should we spend on the wedding? END
BEGIN HERE The most important tip to remember is don't spend out of your means. If you (the bride and groom) are planning the wedding together, have a conversation about how much of a chunk of your savings you want to spend on this one night. Keep in mind future expenses (a possible house, a new car, etc.) before deciding on your wedding budget. If you are getting help from family members, find out how much they are able to give you before you make your budget. END
BEGIN HERE The other thing you need to do is research the average price of different wedding expenses in your area (venues, flowers, photographers, etc.). Make a spreadsheet detailing these costs and then add them up for a grand total. This will give you a range of how much a traditional wedding in your area will cost. If you start to see it's way out of your budget, you'll be able to identify specific line items you can cut out or you may opt in for a smaller scaled wedding — perhaps even a destination wedding.

BEGIN HERE It looks like these two have officially closed the deal! Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles star, Josh Altman, said "I do" to longtime love Heather Bilyeu in a lavish Aspen, Colorado, wedding over the weekend. And it looks like these spared no expense when it came to their marriage ceremony details, including hanging crystal and antler chandeliers, hundreds of gorgeous flowers and more. END
BEGIN HERE After putting their million-dollar style to the test over the weekend in an extravagant wedding ceremony at the St. Regis Aspen Resort in Aspen, Colorado, these two real estate experts can officially say they are off the market, Us Weekly reports. The Bravo series newlyweds chose the traditional route when it came to tying the knot under an opulent Jewish chuppah, which was dramatically embellished with budding white flowers and branches. The ceremony, which took place in front of 82 friends and family, seamlessly accentuated the rustic features of the breathtaking mountain backdrop. END
BEGIN HERE "Aspen Mountain is the backdrop of the ceremony," Bilyeu, who donned a stunning custom Nektaria wedding dress for the occasion (complete with over 6,500 hand sewn pearls and beads), told Us Weekly. "We really wanted to....have our décor work with that and showcase the mountain and play up the rustic Aspen vibes." END
BEGIN HERE Thanks to the clever wedding hashtag #altmanatthealtar, the couple and their lucky guests showcased the ceremony's gorgeous décor on Instagram, featuring numerous shots of the extravagant altar, which was surrounded by a slew of "rustic chic" elements, including frosted green accents and hanging crystal and antler chandeliers. The couple's flower designer Aspen Branch featured a catalogue of various angles of the stunning chuppah made of natural wood beams and flowers. END
BEGIN HERE Another popular social media moment included several photos capturing the stunning bride's detailed corset gown. Bilyeu posted a snapshot of her gown's detailed train and elegant veil, with a caption that included a sweet shout out to her new husband. "Words can't describe how happy I am to be married to my best friend," wrote the bride. "This was an incredible 4 day celebration with friends, family and my now husband @thejoshaltman. Thank you for making me the happiest girl in the world baby. I love you - Mrs. Altman." END
BEGIN HERE For the pre-ceremony reception, the bride and groom sipped on hot apple cider and hot chocolate before handing out faux fur throws to warm guests for the outdoor nuptials. "It's totally family oriented," said Altman, going on to describe his gorgeous wedding as an intimate affair. "It's just really close family and friends and a celebration." END
BEGIN HERE After exchanging vows, the couple and their wedding guests retreated to a reception held at the Caribou Club lodge, which featured comfort food snacks of mac and cheese balls, truffle French fries and pigs in a blanket. END
BEGIN HERE As for the guest list, and everything in between, the reality show real estate agents made sure no boundaries were set when it came to experiencing a wedding weekend of a lifetime! "We like making fun of ourselves because we're in the public eye," said the groom, "It [was] everyone from the owner of our company to my college roommate to my biggest client to a family friend," added Bilyeu.

BEGIN HERE The Laguna Beach cast is definitely not in high school anymore. After watching Lauren Conrad and her band of BFFs grow up, finish high school and start their own successful lives on television and in the public eye, it's hard not to feel super excited when one of them has an exciting life event (because, confession, we totally feel like they're our own BFFs from high school). Now former Laguna Beach and The Hills star Casey Reinhardt is the latest cast-member to announce major life news... She's pregnant! END
BEGIN HERE "We are so excited to announce that we're having a baby!" Reinhardt, who recently married Sean Brown, told E! News. "Our sweet little angel is already surrounded by so much love, we feel absolutely blessed and cannot wait to be parents!" END
BEGIN HERE So exciting for these two newlyweds, who married just six weeks ago in a stunning, lavish California wedding. The self-titled "Cupcake Queen" even had singer Sara Bareilles perform at her extravagant nuptials, as well as a fireworks display for all their guests. END
BEGIN HERE But now these two are switching from honeymoon phase to nesting! With their exciting pregnancy news, we can't help but wonder if Reinhardt will ask any of her former co-stars for parenting advice. In January, Laguna Beach alum Alex Murrel announced she was pregnant and expecting a baby boy with an adorable Instagram video. "We are so excited to know we are having a little boy!" the MTV star told E! News at the time. "My husband thought it was going to be a girl, but I always knew it was going to be boy. Now the hard part is names! I have none!" END
BEGIN HERE Reinhardt can also always turn to reality star/mom-of-three/author Kristin Cavallari, whose new book Balancing in Heels is full of parenting advice. An added bonus, if she needs help planning the baby shower we have a feeling Lauren Conrad has a few helpful party hints to share (she is the DIY queen after all). END
BEGIN HERE With so many of our favorite reality stars having kids all at once, maybe there's hope for a Laguna Beach revival? One can only dream! END
BEGIN HERE  Audrina Patridge Flaunts Sparkling Baby Bump Just Days After Revealing Baby's Sex END
BEGIN HERE We're sure that back in 2011, when Alyssa Campanella was crowned Miss USA, she never thought anything could top that moment. Well, this might just take the (wedding) cake. The former national pageant winner just married her longtime love, Reign actor Torrance Coombs, and their California vineyard nuptials earned a perfect score from our judges. END
BEGIN HERE "After six beautiful years together, this just feels right and how it's supposed to be," Campanella told People of her April 2 wedding to the CW star. A pageant queen and an on-screen monarchy member? Now this is what we call a royal wedding! "Torrance has been my husband in my heart for years, and now it is really official," gushed the beautiful bride. END
BEGIN HERE The romantic alfresco event, which took place at Santa Ynez, California's Sunstone Vineyards, was every bit as gorgeous as one could imagine. But even the sun-drenched luxe landscape couldn't compete with Campanella's wedding dress. The now-fashion blogger knew what she was doing when she choose a French lace and silk gown with dainty illusion sleeves and a 12-foot cathedral train, crafted by designer Lauren Elaine. The bride's inspiration for the ultra-romantic frock? Grace Kelly's classic 1956 wedding dress and Kate Middleton's 2011 iconic gown. END
BEGIN HERE According to People, Campanella's gaggle of bridesmaids also donned Lauren Elaine creations in various hues of cream and ivory, complete with chapel-length trains of ivory silk and chiffon. Guess years of choosing pageant gowns will teach you a thing or two about shopping for the perfect dress! END
BEGIN HERE As a former pageant pro, Campanella is no stranger to costume changes. The bride slipped into a modern caped reception dress after the "I dos." And as the night went on, guests munched on a floral-adorned naked wedding cake, danced under the stars, and Instagrammed the affair using one of the cutest wedding hashtags we've ever seen. This former Miss USA has definitely earned her wedding planning crown! END
BEGIN HERE  The Most Iconic Brides of All Time END
BEGIN HERE It's hard to please everyone. But no bride wants to ask her closest friends to spend $200+ on a dress that they're going to wear once. Luckily, the diversely dressed but still cohesive bridal party look is in, according to Joe Volpe of Cescaphe Events. "We are seeing mismatched gowns way more often than uniform looks," he says. This often means that brides will pick a small handful of dresses for their bridesmaids to choose from, or specify a color family and let their pals select their own wardrobes — with approval of course. END
BEGIN HERE If you're leaning towards giving your girls a lot of freedom to pick their ensembles, Alex Chalk of Taylor'd Events suggests providing a few helpful guidelines beyond color. How short or how long you prefer the dresses to be, whether or not and what type of embellishment they can have, and what kinds of fabric you like area all good ideas for guidance. "Having them know what you don't want is always just as important as what you do want," she adds. A Pinterest board with some options is a great way to show them what you have in mind, while encouraging them to pin dresses they're considering. Chalk also says to urge your bridesmaids to buy early. "That way if something just isn't fitting in, you can work with them to find something else." END
BEGIN HERE For brides who want a little more control (we don't blame you!), be more specific in your instructions. "What I always suggest to clients is pick a designer and color then have the bridesmaids select the dress they like," says Jennifer Taylor of Taylor'd Events. This ensures that you'll like the general aesthetic while giving your girls a bit of a say in what they wear. END
BEGIN HERE These approaches are especially useful because what's flattering on one bridesmaid may not be on another, so body types should be a consideration. "Everyone comes in different shapes and sizes," says Araceli Vizcaino-S of Azazie, who thinks that women who have larger chests are more comfortable in gowns that are pleated at the top, versus draped. She also recommends avoiding low-cut or keyhole styles and opting to for an illusion neckline instead because not everyone wants to wear a strapless dress. When it comes to length, long gowns are good for elongating legs but knee-length can look really good when all the bridesmaids are different heights, Vizcaino-S says. END
BEGIN HERE Your bridal party will also appreciate seasonally appropriate fabrics. "If it's summertime or if you're planning a destination wedding on the shores of a distant beach, opt for lighter fabrics that will provide air circulation like chiffon or organza. While winter weddings can certainly showcase heavier fabrics like satin or silk, the weight of these fabrics can be stifling in the heat," says Vizcaino-S. END
BEGIN HERE Looking to narrow down the options to just one dress for everyone? Vizcaino-S says that a knee-length dress with a sweetheart neckline is universally flattering. "[It] is a winner every single time." And if you're going that route, Volpe thinks giving the bridal party a choice in their shoes, accessories, or hairstyle is a nice gesture. They are your nearest and dearest pals after all. END
BEGIN HERE When in doubt, look to the stars to help you figure your wedding plans out. From what projects to tackle to when to get them done, astrologer Joan Porte offers up her celestial guidance for the week ahead. Brides, listen up! END
BEGIN HERE   Neptune is squaring Vesta right now. This asteroid puts roadblocks in your way and forces you to work extra hard to make your dreams a reality. No one dreams bigger or better than Pisces, but you can get discouraged about Vesta's brick walls in your path. Don't get frustrated — instead, keep at it. Once Vesta is defeated, she allows your dreams to materialize. She just asks you to work for your goals. END
BEGIN HERE That pre-wedding girl time is critical. You get to get all dolled up, surrounded by the women who know you best and love you the most. It's a time for happy tears, champagne toasts, and cute photos galore, all topped off with the moment you get into your wedding dress. And while Mom, Sis and your bridesmaids will definitely be on the VIP list of who's getting gussied up in your suite, what about your future mother-in-law? She is, after all, a woman, and she's about to become a major part of your life (if she isn't one already). So should she join you all for your pampering session? Our experts weigh in. END
BEGIN HERE If you have a good relationship with your future mother-in-law and are getting married in a fairly central/accessible location, by all means, invite her to join you. You can either have her come up to your hotel suite for the entire morning to hang out, or she can stop in when it's her turn in the makeup chair, sip on a little bubbly, and then head back to her room to finish getting ready. Does your fiancé have a sister who isn't in the bridal party? You should invite her along, as well! END
BEGIN HERE If you're getting ready at a local salon, you should also invite your mother-in-law to be a part of the excitement. Again, encourage her to hang out for as long as she'd like, since you and your 'maids might be there for a while! END
BEGIN HERE 3 Things the Mother of the Groom Can Do to Help Reduce the Bride's Stress END
BEGIN HERE Planning a wedding in your hometown and getting ready at your parents' house? Who you invite to get ready with you might depend on how much space you have. If you have the room, keep the group as inclusive as possible. Tight on space? You might need to narrow down the guest list, or consider heading to a salon instead. END
BEGIN HERE While your mother-in-law doesn't have to get ready with you the morning of the wedding, inviting her is a super sweet gesture, and a way to acknowledge that, in a few short hours, you'll be family. END
BEGIN HERE Two years after first meeting at the Abbey in West Hollywood in 2011, Rachel Waters and Brittany Collins were both certain they wanted to spend the rest of their lives together. But it was Brittany who made the big move. For Rachel's birthday in December of 2013, Brittany surprised her with a photo session for the couple and their beloved dogs at El Matador Beach. When the photographer asked Rachel to turn and face the ocean for a few photos, Brittany dropped to one knee and pulled out a ring. END
BEGIN HERE The pair decided to wed on July 4, 2015, at the Westlake Village Inn in Westlake Village, California, which was fitting as Brittany serves as a pilot in the United States Air Force. With the help of Christine Sperry of Christie Rose Events, the couple spent 18 months planning a pale pink, white, and gold celebration with a classic, romantic aesthetic. Gina & Ryan Photography captured every moment of this sweet pair's wedding day, all seen below! END

BEGIN HERE Here at BRIDES, we live, breathe, and dream weddings — and sharing our tips and tricks to planning the perfect day is the core of what we do. That's why we were so excited to kick off our first bridal guest in the BRIDES fashion closet — as part of our new BRIDES Private Access, an expert wedding style consultation service for brides-to-be. Our first bride, Emily, is getting married on August 27, 2016, so she utilized our VIP services (which include touring our Manhattan offices and receiving a full day of pampering and wedding planning with our genius editors in our coveted fashion closet). Here, we share a little bit about her bridal experience at our Condé Nast offices in New York City. END
BEGIN HERE Emily's day started with a delicious breakfast at our luxurious World Trade Center dining area (with a beautiful view of the city from top!) where she enjoyed a delicious made-to-order breakfast with one of our editors. From there, the bride-to-be was whisked away into our lace and tulle wonderland — the BRIDES fashion closet! Inside our wedding-planning sanctuary, shoes, dresses, and bridal jewelry galore are fit to be tried — all at the bride-to-be's disposal. BRIDES' Editor-in-Chief, Keija Minor, was there to greet her, and after enjoying some French macarons while chatting everything weddings, it was time to get serious. END

Before the BRIDES Private Access experience, Emily explained that she had no idea of what she was looking for dress-wise. "I came in only having pinned a few things on Pinterest and ripping out a few pages of a magazine." Luckily, our editors came to the rescue and helped her consider some styles to accentuate her best features and flatter her physique — with results that will definitely 'wow' her groom on the big day.

BEGIN HERE In the white dress wonderland, Emily perused the couture gowns and luxurious styles with the help of our fashion director, Elle Strauss, who stopped by to give some wedding-style tips. Our bride-to-be picked several styles to try — and of course her try-on sesh included a "Say Yes to the Dress" moment, where she picked her favorite! END

BEGIN HERE I don't think any couple out there wants to tell any of their single friends that they can't bring a date to their wedding. We've all been single invitees at weddings, and we've all felt awkward about it at some point, especially if we didn't know many of the other guests. END
BEGIN HERE Unfortunately, with the cost of weddings — per person — being what they are, some couples simply cannot afford to allow all their single friends to have plus ones at their weddings. It's not that they don't want to give their friends the option, it's that letting 10 friends bring a date could add up to between one and two thousand dollars in extra expense, depending on the cost per guest. Those 10 plus-ones are seats at the table that the bride and groom could not use for friends and extended family. END
BEGIN HERE When faced with whether to invite more good friends or to let several members of their wedding party has plus-ones, most couples will give into tradition and simply deal with the wrath of their single friends. END
BEGIN HERE But there are times when adding a plus-one to an invitation is mandatory: END
BEGIN HERE - If the guest is living with someone, you must invite their significant other. Even if you've never met them. END

BEGIN HERE Remember, nobody wants to feel alone or disconnected at a wedding. You have to use common sense to try to ensure that all of your guests have a good time. But sometimes, telling unattached friends to bring a date actually puts more pressure on them and results in less fun at the wedding, especially if they feel compelled to bring someone they don't know very well.

BEGIN HERE If your old college friend is coming from far away and isn't in the wedding party and doesn't know anybody but you, giving them the option to bring an escort is a very nice thing to do. But if it's your BFFs who are in your wedding party griping, and you know they don't have a serious love interest they're dying to spend your special day with, stick to your guns and keep them solo. They'll still have a blast — promise. END

BEGIN HERE Here comes the... Barbie? Yup. And she's all dressed in Oscar de la Renta. When two fashion icons team up, the match is bound to be as perfect as you and your future hubby. And is there anyone more fashionable than the fantastically plastic doll from your childhood, or quite as synonymous with bridalwear as the legendary fashion house, Oscar de la Renta? Nope, we didn't think so. Oscar de la Renta and Mattel's Barbie are teaming up with the release of an Oscar de la Renta bridal Barbie doll. If you didn't dream of being Barbie as a little girl, you sure will now... END
BEGIN HERE "We are honored to work with the Oscar de la Renta team on this beautiful design capturing their signature bridal look in Barbie scale," says the mastermind of the toy couture creation, Robert Best, senior design director at Barbie. "Barbie is the only girl who can have a closet full of wedding dresses without ever walking down the aisle." With a wardrobe that'll apparently rival even the fashion closet at BRIDES, consider us officially jealous. END
BEGIN HERE To put it lightly, the Oscar de la Renta Barbie is the doll of your childhood dreams. (If you had exceptional taste as a child, that is!) The certified collectible is ripe with all of the bridal inspiration you'll ever need. And before you start rolling your eyes at the thought of getting your wedding day inspo from a doll, just check her out. The blonde chignon, that smoky eye bridal beauty look, and that dress... Oh yes, that dress. Ripped straight from Oscar de la Renta's signature bridal runway show, the miniature frock, complete with a cream embossed sheath and something-blue tulle, is a doll-sized dream dress that you'll desperately want in your own size. It may be a wedding day faux pas for your  guests to wear white, but who says you can't match with Barbie? END

BEGIN HERE Well this looks pretty official! After repeatedly sparking engagement rumors, possible pregnancy news, and a lot of the usual Kardashian family drama, it's safe to say that Rob Kardashian and his possible fiancée Blac Chyna have seen their fair share of relationship gossip. After recently posting a very convincing photo on Instagram with a giant engagement ring-looking sparkler on that finger, and a very suggestive caption, the engagement rumors are swirling more than ever! Could there possibly be another Kardashian wedding in the works? END
BEGIN HERE After constant social media posts, and numerous engagement hints, could this be the Instagram photo that confirms a bended knee moment from the Keeping Up With the Kardashians brother? The possible bride-to-be took to social media Tuesday morning (or late Monday night, for the West coasters) to post a beaming photo of her and her reality show beau, grinning from ear-to-ear in what looks to be a snapshot confirming their engagement! The photo shows Chyna with a clear view of a seriously stunning, and GIANT, diamond ring on her all-important finger sitting beside a beaming Kardashian. Chyna used a mysterious Instagram caption to further hint toward a possible engagement by writing, "YES!...!...!" It's hard to be clearer than that! END
BEGIN HERE But this isn't the first time (or the second) that this inseparable pair has sparked serious commitment rumors! Just two weeks after the pair confirmed their relationship, rumors already started to swirl of a possible proposal. It wasn't until Chyna posted a photo (which has since been deleted) wearing a very suggestive diamond ring. The entertainer also posted a photo during the Trinidad Carnival in Spain, which curiously hinted toward the new bling. END
BEGIN HERE  Our Favorite Celebrity Engagement Rings END
BEGIN HERE Despite the possible good news of a future Kardashian wedding (we can only hope!), the happiness hasn't come without it's own fair of family drama. After announcing their relationship back in January, things have been a little complicated between Chyna and the Kardashian-Jenner squad due to reasons like Chyna being the mother of Tyga's son, King Cairo, but Tyga is currently dating the youngest member of ultra-famous family, Kylie Jenner. Yep, it's complicated! END
BEGIN HERE Putting all of their differences aside, the family is reportedly thrilled that the once troubled Kardashian heir is now back on his feet. "The family is really happy that they're together," a source told Entertainment Tonight. The changes Rob has made in his life are so good. They appreciate Chyna for that." END
BEGIN HERE Even momager, Kris Jenner, made a comment toward the happy couple stating, "I haven't really seen her that much and I don't know her as well as everyone else, but she seems really nice. I just haven't been around her too much. But, you know, he's been very, very happy lately and I think he's in a really good place. I don't know too much about their relationship," Jenner revealed in a recent radio interview. END

BEGIN HERE   "We're seeing a lot of items that are locally sourced. Not necessarily organic, but people are looking to highlight a name of an actual farm where ingredients for the salad came from. People love the idea of having things that are representative of local cuisine. People are also doing more small plates — almost like tapas-style menus — and doing those with either a beer or wine pairing. For a couple that's looking for a more interactive experience where guests can move around and go to different stations, this would be a great menu for them." —Tina Guenther, Greens Point Catering, Denver END

BEGIN HERE What does a single gal dread more than attending a wedding? Attending said wedding alone, some might say. "It's easy to feel self-conscious when everyone else at the wedding seems to be coupled," commiserates Irene S. Levine, Ph.D., psychologist, friendship expert, and creator of The Friendship Blog. END
BEGIN HERE With wedding tables set up to accommodate even, not odd, numbers and the dance floor crammed with gyrating lovebirds, the proverbial wedding decks can seem stacked against single people — especially those denied a plus-one by their hosts. "A single person may be placed at a table with people she barely knows, and feel socially awkward, especially if she is shy," Levine says. "She could also feel like all eyes are on her, even when they're not." END
BEGIN HERE What's worse, if a woman wants to be married, attending a wedding alone can evoke feelings of self-pity, "even if she feels happy for her friend," explains Levine. "She may feel left behind." END
BEGIN HERE But there's good news: You can beat the plus-one-less blues. In fact, you can fly happily solo at your next wedding event with these expert survival tips. END
BEGIN HERE   Yes, attending a wedding without a plus-one can be the pits. But if you can keep things in perspective, you can forget you're flying solo and really have fun. "Remember that you are there to celebrate and support your friend," Levine says. "It's her important day and just another day for you. By inviting you, your friend has told you that you are an important person in her life." END
BEGIN HERE Do you dread the hours you'll have to spend agonizing over seating charts for your wedding reception? Chances are there is NO WAY you'll want to do the same for your ceremony, but at the same time you'll want your VIPs seated right up front so they don't miss the action. While it's fairly common knowledge that the front row on either side is reserved for the bride and groom's parents and siblings, what about the rest of your family? Here are some tips from our experts on reserving seats for your relatives at your wedding ceremony. END
BEGIN HERE There's no need to shell out for "Reserved" signs for every single chair (phew!). All you'll really need is an usher or two, a proactive planner or venue manager, and maybe a little ribbon. END
BEGIN HERE First, let your ushers know which rows are reserved (usually the first three or four on each side of the aisle, depending on how large the bride or groom's family is). Then, as they're escorting guests to their seats, they can either seat family members in the designated rows or seat other guests behind them. If your ushers will be providing more directions than actually escorting guests (especially if you're not having guests sit on either the bride or groom's side), have them say something like "Please sit wherever you'd like. The first three rows are reserved for family, but otherwise please choose wherever you'll be comfortable." END
BEGIN HERE Your wedding planner or venue manager can provide the same service, directing guests toward seats that are available and saving the reserved seats for your family. END
BEGIN HERE  4 Creative Ways to Set Up Your Wedding Ceremony Chairs END
BEGIN HERE If you're planning on having your aisle blocked off, with guests entering the rows of seats from the outer edges instead of the middle, you might consider using the same ribbon you use to block the end of the aisle to also block the ends of the rows reserved for family. An usher escorting family members can then remove the ribbon, help guests into their seats, and put the ribbon back up to prevent other guests from taking the seats you're hoping to save. END
BEGIN HERE Really love some of those calligraphed "Reserved" signs? (We do too!) Consider getting signs that say "Row Reserved" and placing them on either end of the rows you'd like to save. Then let the ushers or your planner point guests in the right direction. END
BEGIN HERE There's something so romantic and elegant about wedding calligraphy, whether it's adorned on your wedding invitation envelopes, escort cards or some other piece of stationery. But these days, couples are finding more and more unique ways to incorporate beautiful hand lettering into their nuptials, like these stunning cake- and dessert-table backdrops.

BEGIN HERE Bachelorette and bride-to-be Ali Fedotowsky's due date is rapidly approaching, so she did what any mom-to-be would do — throw a fabulous spring baby shower with all of her A-list friends, duh. Lucky for us, Fedotowsky and her pals shared photos of the outdoor California-chic baby shower, giving us major spring party planning inspo. Perhaps this is a sign of a spring wedding for the engaged mom-to-be? END
BEGIN HERE Fedotowsky and her growing baby bump stunned in a long floral sundress with a thigh-high slit. It was the perfect look for the fashion blogger behind Ali Luvs and her garden-themed celebration. Each table was covered in floral centerpieces as well as adorned with calligraphed watercolor place cards. Our favorite decoration of the day though had to be the adorable custom drink stirrers (below) that said "Baby Manno" on them. Too cute! END
BEGIN HERE Although the shower was for the mom-to-be and her little bundle of joy, Fedotowsky wasn't the only one sporting a bump. Mean Girls star Lacey Chabert was there too, and showed off her growing belly with the other expectant mom. According to Entertainment Tonight, other A-listers who scored invites were Haylie Duff, Kaley Cuoco, and Amy Davidson. END
BEGIN HERE Fedotowsky's fiancé Kevin Manno even made an appearance at the traditionally all-female party. "I love this man so much and I'm so grateful to be bringing a baby into this world with him," she captioned a sweet pic of her and Manno on Instagram. END
BEGIN HERE The couple has been super vocal about how excited they are to have a little girl, with Fedotowsky convinced that the newest addition to their family is already a daddy's a girl. The bride-to-be said their little one "already has her daddy wrapped around her little finger!" END
BEGIN HERE See the gorgeous photos of the former Bachelorette's baby shower below. END
BEGIN HERE Whether you're a destination bride or just looking to go big (not home!) on your wedding night, where you stay right after you get married is pretty darn important. Do you book a quaint bed and breakfast? Splurge on a five-star hotel suite? Or just grab a room in the block with all your other guests? Hmm...decisions, decisions! To help you make up your mind, we tracked down a few brides, who, in retrospect, really wish they had put a little more thought into the whole wedding night accommodations thing. Perhaps you can learn from their mistakes? END
BEGIN HERE   "I really wish we hadn't decided to book a hotel thirty minutes away from the venue. It made things so much more complicated and stressful than they needed to be. Granted, it was the nicest hotel in town, we could have found something that was decent, comfortable, and much closer and that would have taken my stress levels way down. Not to mention, I could have slept in longer the next morning instead of rushing to make it to our morning after brunch!" — Kailyn END
BEGIN HERE As of late, celebrities seem to be the ultimate wedding crashers. Everyone from power couple Jay Z and Beyoncé to Twilight hunk, Robert Pattinson, have gotten in on the nuptial crashing action. Even President Obama joined the club, after showing up at a golf course where "I do's" were being said. But unfortunately, it looks like Breaking Bad star, Aaron Paul, was on the other side of the wedding crashing festivities, when three fans showed up uninvited to his 2013 nuptials! END
BEGIN HERE When Aaron Paul and his sweetheart, Lauren Parsekian, were thumbing through their wedding photos post-ceremony, they noticed something a little, well, off. Namely, the three guests they didn't recognize! Paul sat down with James Corden of The Late Late Show on Monday, where he recalled the hilarious moment when he and his bride realized their guest list ended up being a little longer than expected, with the addition of a few unknown Breaking Bad fans. END
BEGIN HERE "We had three people crash our wedding," the actor told the talkshow host of his Malibu ceremony. "We didn't know it happened until we started looking through photos of our wedding and we saw these three strangers. We were like, 'Who are these people?'" The tip-off? Paul's big day featured a Parisian carnival theme and the ceremony crashers clearly didn't get the memo, as they showed up in normal wedding wear and "just stood out like a sore thumb," according Paul. END
BEGIN HERE  Further Proof That Aaron Paul Is the Best Husband Ever: Watch Him Surprise Wife Lauren for Her Birthday! END
BEGIN HERE The invited guests sure weren't trying too hard to fly under the radar though, as one member of the illicit group not-so-subtly tried to catch the bride's bouquet. "She drove for it, violently!" Paul remembers. But no, the Breaking Bad wedding crashers did not wear meth-making hazmat suits or throw a pizza onto the roof of the venue, so clearly they lacked dedication. Maybe try again at their next anniversary party, guys... END
BEGIN HERE Wedding day wardrobe changes are becoming pretty popular as brides are eager to show off their unique style. Want to learn how to flawlessly execute a wedding day wardrobe change? Here are eight tips for doing it right. END
BEGIN HERE   "People start leaving when you aren't around, so plan to have something else happening at that time if possible (dinner, dance, video, slideshow, cake is served, etc.). Make it fast and get back out there to reveal it to your guests," says Alex Chalk of Taylor'd Events. END
BEGIN HERE A guy once told me that for men, sex is like pizza: pretty good even when it's bad. Must be nice. After writing about sex for years, talking about it with friends, and having it myself (strictly for research purposes), I know it isn't the same for women. Here, a quick sampling of the topics my friends and I have discussed recently: cervical pain brought on by too-rough pounding, the man who bit my friend's nipple so hard a little of it actually came off, feeling "fat" and nervous about having sex with the lights on, and the guy who promptly left after a blow job even though he'd promised to return the favor. This is all lunacy, and it needs to end. END
BEGIN HERE I got into writing about love and sex in large part because I was frustrated by how the women I knew (including myself at the time) were fine dealing with the sexual equivalent of almost-stale pizza crusts you eat when you're ravenous, but that don't really satiate you. In reality, anyone who has sex should expect the following 13 basic things. It's pretty much impossible to have good sex without them. END
BEGIN HERE Quinn made his way into Kelly's heart the very first time they met: "We were at my maid of honor's birthday party in 2011, and he was on crutches," says Kelly. "I thought it was adorable!" The pair dated for three years before Quinn got down on one knee during a walk along Philadelphia's Boat House Row with their dog, Sully. END
BEGIN HERE The self-described preppy couple knew they wanted to wed in the City of Brotherly Love, choosing St. Patrick's Church for their ceremony and falling for the glitz of the ballroom at the Ritz-Carlton, Philadelphia, for their reception. So on July 18th, 2015, they invited 220 guests to join them for an elegant summer affair, planned by Truly You Events and photographed by Tina Jay Photography.

She paired the gown with a chic chignon, silver Cole Haan pumps, her grandmother's pearl necklace, and a pearl hair comb hand-made by her cousin. A bouquet of navy-centered anemones, peach stock, blush lisianthus, and garden roses, all tied with gold sequin ribbon, was a perfect match for the summer affair. END

BEGIN HERE Your wedding ceremony is one of the most intimate moments of the day. It's the hour that sets the tone and mood for the party to come and it's often a time for an exchange of words that will stick with you for a lifetime. So in order for your ceremony to be personal and something that makes you feel connected, it's important to have a conversation with your officiant beforehand, so they know what you'd like them to say and what you'd like them to take out of the ceremony script. To get you started, here are six things you can ask your wedding officiant not to say during your ceremony. END
BEGIN HERE   It's a bit outdated for the officiant to ask wedding guest for any objections, but sometimes they do. Even though it's unlikely that anyone will speak up, this is one part of the ceremony you can ask your officiant to press the delete button on. END

BEGIN HERE I've been a marriage and family counselor for more than 40 years and I'm still surprised at how little we know about relationships and what really turns women on. It took me many years to understand two statements my wife made about what turned her on. END
BEGIN HERE "I really get turned on when you do the dishes," Carlin tells me. I'll admit that statement got me doing more dishes, but I never really believed her. END
BEGIN HERE "I really get turned on when you go to the doctor," she told me. I don't like seeing doctors, but I do want to stay healthy and prevent little problems from becoming big problems. So, I go. But I never believed it had anything to do with our sex life. END
BEGIN HERE As I've gotten older I realize how wise my wife really is — like most things in life, the gift is in the details. In the small, day-to-day events of our lives. END
BEGIN HERE I've learned that it's how we respond to the hundreds of verbal and non-verbal requests for emotional connection that will determine whether our relationship flourishes or wilts on the vine. END
BEGIN HERE I realized that washing dishes is really about a lot more than washing dishes. It tells my wife that I care about her desire to have a clean kitchen every day. It tells her that I'm aware that bending over the sink to wash can aggravate her back and my remembering to do the dishes every day shows I care and respect her comfort. END
BEGIN HERE Going to the doctor, sexy? Well, think of it this way — a sick husband is about the most "unsexy" being on the face of the planet. When I'm sick, I'm angry and ashamed I'm not the "big, strong, man," I long to be. I'm totally ambivalent about being taken care of. I want and need Carlin's care and support, yet I'm afraid of appearing needy. END
BEGIN HERE My conflicted feelings make me a bear to be around, much less want to engage romantically. END
BEGIN HERE Going to the doctor and taking care of my health, I see now is truly a gift not only to myself, but also to Carlin. It also helps keep our relationship juicy and hot. END
BEGIN HERE There are 6 words the media teaches men that we should ALWAYS say to our partner. We've all heard them — the big three: "I love you". And the REALLY big three: "I am sorry". END

BEGIN HERE First, most women have heard these words so much they bear no meaning. Second, most of us use them as a way to placate our partner — not because they are truly heart-felt. And third — they are words, not actions. My wife would much rather I demonstrated my love for her or my remorse when I've screwed up, rather than talking about it. END
BEGIN HERE The day has come, you have that scanner gun in your hand... But wait, which pots and pans do you pick? Before you head to that store (or go online) to make your registry, you and your fiancé should do some research. Sound overwhelming? Just consider how much more overwhelming it will be inside a store with hundreds of options of sheets, and 10 different sales people with 10 different opinions. So before you shop, do your homework. END
BEGIN HERE   You've learned the terms, felt the differences, and now you don't know which direction to go. Before you register, talk to your fiancé about what fits best into your lifestyle. Do you need everything to be dishwasher safe? That's an important thing to consider when shopping for dinnerware, barware, pots and pans, and knives. Are you the type that entertains a lot? Consider if fragile items are really right for a crowded dining room that might be prone to accidents. Knowing the type of couple you are will help you along in finding the right items for your home.

BEGIN HERE If there's one thing we love more than anything here at BRIDES (well, almost anything), it's celebrity engagement rings. Some stars, like newly engaged Alison Brie and Dave Franco or Pitch Perfect's Anna Camp and Skylar Astin, opt for the trendy rose gold sparklers, while others, like Mariah Carey and her billionaire fiancé James Packer, go for the gigantic 30-plus carat engagement rings (seriously, how does she even lift her left hand?!). And now we can add Real Housewives of New York star LuAnn de Lesseps' bling to our growing list of favorite famous sparklers! The Countess has been sporting a stunning (and HUGE) yellow diamond engagement ring since her boyfriend-turned-fiancé Tom D'Agostino Jr. popped the question in early February. The new season of the ever-popular Bravo series is premiering Wednesday night, and we can only hope that this eighth installment of Big Apple drama brings with it an on-camera proposal for the Real Housewife. END
BEGIN HERE But, while we're anxiously counting the hours until we hear those superb opener taglines, we're counting the carats of these famous ladies' famous sparklers — whether they currently wear them, or not. From LuAnn's brand new bling to Bethenny Frankel's no-longer-on-her-finger pear-shaped ring, these are our favorite engagement and wedding rings from the current leading ladies (sorry, not sorry, Kristen Taekman!) on the Real Housewives of New York. END

Jules (that's what she goes by) happens to be the only RHONY that's actually married — at least, until LuAnn walks down the aisle. The event planner-turned-stay-at-home mom married her venture capitalist husband, Michael Wainstein, in 2008 in a lavish Jewish ceremony in the Dominican Republic. Just check out this #tbt shot of her and her hubby on their wedding day! END

BEGIN HERE Just six months before O.J. Simpson was on trial for double homicide, he should've been on trial for a major wedding guest faux pas! The BRIDES court in in session and we're calling The Juice to the stand. Before his 1994 arrest, the notorious football star (and current Nevada inmate) attended Donald Trump's ultra-lavish wedding to his second wife, Marla Maples, and had a few words to say about the bride and groom. He may be good for football tips and murder defense strategies, but you definitely wouldn't want to steal any wedding toast pointers from O.J. (or sports memorabilia for that matter...). END
BEGIN HERE Before he was the Republican nominee front-runner and she was a Dancing with the Stars contestant, Donald Trump and his now ex-wife Marla Maples tied the knot in an opulent Plaza Hotel wedding covered by 17 television crews, a gaggle of gossip writers, and 90 paparazzi photographers, according to the New York Times. The 1993 wedding was clearly the place to be for Manhattan socialites, the entertainment industry's glitterati, and, apparently, football stars. The former San Francisco 49ers running back may have scored an invitation to Trump's over-the-top "I do's," but his wedding toast however, was no touchdown. END
BEGIN HERE In a video obtained by Inside Edition that resurfaced just this week, O.J. Simpson can be seen outside of the iconic New York City venue, as wedding guests filtered in and flashing cameras tried to snap photos of the newlyweds. Stopping to speak to a reporter, Simpson decided to say a few words about the billionaire and his bride. "I think everybody in the country believes that maybe their relationship could work if this relationship works." Um, ouch... END
BEGIN HERE Words like that are a knife in the gut to a bride and groom. (Sorry, that was in poor taste...) Perhaps bringing up the notion that if the union between an infamous womanizer and his former mistress could last (spoiler alert: it didn't), any marriage could pull through, isn't the best way to to commemorate someone's "I do's." Turns out O.J's toast was more akin to a roast. END

BEGIN HERE Setting a date for your wedding is not only super exciting, it also gets the ball rolling on the rest of the planning process (basically you finally have free reign to make all your wedding dreams come true!). Before you put a deposit down and say "I do" to a summer soiree or a winter-wonderland affair, though, you'll want to put some serious thought and consideration into what wedding season truly is right for you. Naturally, we're here to help! END
BEGIN HERE   While dressing for the occasion is always key, this rule also works the other way around, according to Cooke. If you have a vision of what you, your wedding party, and even guests will wear, choose a time of year that is appropriate, she advises. "Black tie is seasonally universal, but we wouldn't recommend it for an outdoor July wedding in the Southeast. However, if you're in love with a lightweight strapless gown and you want your girls in short dresses, the warmer seasons are probably for you." END
BEGIN HERE A new Kardashian is about to be born, but this time, not by birth! It looks like marrying into the Kardashian family means the chance to adopt their very famous last name — at least that's the plan for newly engaged model Blac Chyna, who recently confirmed her whirlwind engagement news with Rob Kardashian. After less than 4 months of dating, this highly talked about duo is already talking post-marriage plans, and the adoption of the famous moniker. END
BEGIN HERE After a media frenzied social media post that most likely broketheinternet (sorry Kim!) it looks as if the youngest Kardashian heir is officially engaged! Sealing the deal with a gigantic engagement ring, it's no surprise that this rumor-swirling couple is still controlling the news cycle when it comes to their post-marriage plans. Blac Chyna, whose real name is Angela White, plans to go by Angela Kardashian after tying the knot, Us Weekly reports. That's a lot of name-dropping — literally! END
BEGIN HERE Kardashian popped the question to his almost-Kardashian other half with a gigantic 7-carat diamond ring that he helped design with celebrity jeweler Ben Baller. "She was very excited and loves the ring. She's happy with him and very happy," the bride-to-be's rep told Us Weekly. The celebrated ring designer also gushed about the Kardashian younger brother's sentimental task of designing the ring. "Rob had a couple of small ideas," said Baller, adding that the newly engaged reality star "wanted it to be elegant, but still be impressive." It certainly is! END
BEGIN HERE Even though the news of the pair's engagement was still a bit of a mystery Tuesday morning, due to the couple's recent track record of false engagement rumors, Chyna is certainly clearing things up through Instagram to prove that this time it's the real deal! After posting the ring-selfie seen around the world, which featured a beaming Chyna and Kardashian, the bride-to-be followed up the cryptic post with a clear confirmation of a bended knee moment. "I'm so blessed and honored to have good man in my life, I love you @robkardashian ! 7carats," a newly engaged Chyna captioned for her close-up video of a very sparkly diamond ring! The makeup artist also posted a series of engagement-confirming photos featuring a cartoon version of herself and the recently low-profile Kardashian brother, with a clear image of a ring on that finger. END
BEGIN HERE But what exactly do the other Kardashian-Jenner squad members have to say about this couple's somewhat controversial commitment? So far, Kardashian's mom, Kris Jenner, and his three famous sisters have yet to comment. We probably won't expect to hear anything from the youngest Jenner sister, Kylie, seeing that she is currently dating Tyga, whom Chyna shares a son with. Talk about some serious family ties! END

There will be late nights organizing your master wedding to-do list, weekend appointments making decisions alongside vendors you're paying a lot of money to, and of course, the occasional cry-fest because the pressure of throwing the party of your lifetime has caught up to you.

BEGIN HERE As a general rule, I haven't seen good results for my brides who have chosen to book group travel for their destination weddings. That doesn't mean that you can't get the cheapest deals by working with a travel agent for a group package — sometimes you can get better airfare or additional perks at the hotel. The question is whether the perks make up for having to travel en masse throughout the wedding. END
BEGIN HERE Sometimes, brides and grooms try to create their own group travel without using a travel agent — frequently, that doesn't end well. I did it for my own wedding and, although it wasn't a complete disaster, I'm pretty sure the people whose flights arrived on time in San Juan were not thrilled about waiting in an airport for a few hours for the guests whose flights had been delayed. Some lost a half day of vacation that way. END
BEGIN HERE The moral of the story: If you're going to do group travel, let a professional arrange it. If something goes wrong, your guests will be blowing up the travel agent's phone and not yours. Helping friends who missed flights can suck up a lot of your playtime during the first days of your destination wedding weekend. END
BEGIN HERE Nowadays, most people travel, and some of your guests probably travel frequently, for business and for pleasure. They have their own preferred airlines and hotel chains, and they like to take advantage of their miles and points whenever they can. If they use travel agents, they have one they prefer and trust. They know what time they prefer to fly, and how long they like to stay, and whether they want to turn your wedding weekend into their own extended vacation. It's hard to personalize your trip when the bride and groom are trying to arrange your travel schedule in a manner that accommodates a larger group. END
BEGIN HERE Another complaint I've heard from guests roped into group travel packages is that they didn't get anything close to direct flights. Depending on who is offering the package, some group rates will give you the cheapest airfares the most roundabout way. It may not be worth the savings to people who just want to get where they're going quickly. END
BEGIN HERE   If you have a travel agent you trust and want to offer discounted group rates to your guests, don't sign up for something that requires an unrealistic number of participants to get the pricing you want. Some guests will appreciate your efforts and will jump right on board. The rest can do whatever they like as long as they get to your wedding on time! END

BEGIN HERE When news of Cameron Diaz and Benji Madden's marriage hit in January 2015, we were shocked, to say the least. The couple tied the knot after being engaged for less than a month — and only after months of speculation and fake-outs — and before that, the pair was together for less than a year. Their whirlwind romance left us in a total daze! We were left with basically no details of the love story between Diaz and Madden. But now, finally, the 43-year-old actress is opening up about how she met her 37-year-old rocker hubby, and the sweet relationship that these two lovebirds share. END
BEGIN HERE During an appearance on Andy Cohen's Radio Andy, the former Charlie's Angels star recalled how she and "Benj" became an item, E! News reports. "It was one of those things where everyone tells you, 'You just know when you know,'" she explained. "I was like, 'What does that mean? Oh, I get it. You just know when you know.' Like you're my husband." END
BEGIN HERE cameron diaz gif END
BEGIN HERE Although she knew the former Good Charlotte rocker's sister-in-law, Nicole Richie, and his brother, Joel Madden, for a few years, the actress and Benji didn't really cross paths. "The first thing I said when I first met my [would be] husband was, 'He's hot,'" Diaz confessed. "How come I didn't know this before? We had never been in the same circle." END
BEGIN HERE Diaz didn't formally meet her now-husband until she hosted a dinner party at her house with Nicole and Joel, who asked Cameron if he could invite his brother Benji over. "Then I saw him again," she continued. "Wait a second, still hot!" END
BEGIN HERE The two instantly hit it off and began seeing each other, leading to what would ultimately become one of our favorite Hollywood duos. Interestingly enough, now that she's married to her rocker love, Diaz doesn't think about anyone else in her past. "You know, nothing matters now that I have my husband. Like, I don't even remember any of that. All of that is like, that's the thing, that's how I know he's my husband...No one compares. Everything else just like washes and slips away," she said. "You realize like, 'Oh this is like the real thing is. This is what real love is. This is what real commitment and devotion is. This is the person you build your life with.'" (Though how one could forget about dating uber-hottie Justin Timberlake, we really don't know.) END
BEGIN HERE justin timberlake gif END
BEGIN HERE She added, "We got married in our living room in front of our friends. Had a little party in our backyard on the tennis court and yeah. Otherwise it would have been something else." Diaz forgot to mention the slew of celebrities that joined in their nuptials, like Reese Witherspoon, Gwyneth Paltrow and Drew Barrymore, to name a few. END
BEGIN HERE  4 Celebrity Honeymoon Trips You Can Totally Recreate END
BEGIN HERE Chatting with Cohen isn't the only time Diaz has gushed about her hubs. In her new book The Longevity Book: The Science of Aging, the Biology of Strength, and the Privilege of Time, the actress penned the most heartfelt dedication to her spouse: "I never knew what love was until I found you," she writes. "How did I ever live without your love, your friendship, your brilliant mind, your genius sense of humor, and your enormous, loving, beautiful heart?" END
BEGIN HERE "Thank you for being my best friend, my teacher, my partner in life," Diaz adds, according to Entertainment Tonight. "You inspire me every day with your courage and devotion. Thank you for all the support and encouragement in this book and everything in life. I love you forever and ever." END
BEGIN HERE Figuring out your wedding guest list is hard enough, so the last thing you probably want to do is put together yet another guest list for your morning-after brunch. However, inviting everyone to join you the next morning can feel like hosting another reception, with the catering costs to match. So can you cut this list down, or do you have to invite all of your guests for a farewell/hangover breakfast? Our experts weigh in. END
BEGIN HERE The short answer is no, you don't have to invite everyone to the morning-after brunch, but you should definitely be intentional about who you do invite. Immediate family? Definitely. Wedding party and their plus-ones? Put them on the list! Grandparents? Mm-hmm! END
BEGIN HERE Beyond that, use your discretion, but be consistent. If you're going to invite extended family members (aunts, uncles, and cousins), do so for both of your families. If you want to add some of your friends to the list, it should be all of your friends on both sides, as well as your mutual friends. Of course, at that point you might as well just invite everyone! END
BEGIN HERE  Do You Have to Host a Brunch the Day After the Wedding? END
BEGIN HERE If you're keeping the guest list small, either include an insert in the invitations that are destined for the guests in question, or send out an e-vite to more easily track RSVPs. Don't put the brunch on your wedding website, otherwise the rest of your guests might assume they're also invited. END
BEGIN HERE If you do end up inviting everyone to your brunch, there are a few ways to help keep the cost low. Limiting the breakfast offerings to coffee, tea, juice, pastries, and fruit is a great option, as is a limited buffet of scrambled eggs, potatoes, and bacon. Skipping the alcohol (sorry, no mimosas and bloodies!) will also help you limit the costs. If your venue has a bar and offers brunch cocktails, guests could head to the bar to purchase drinks themselves. END
BEGIN HERE Don't feel badly about shrinking down the brunch guest list. Remember that you'll be tired (and you'll have spent the entire night before socializing!), so you might not be doing much more than sipping strong coffee, anyway! END
BEGIN HERE After you get engaged, one of the next things you'll be ultra excited to mark off your wedding-planning checklist is selecting your bridesmaids. For some brides, this is something you've probably thought about for many years. Maybe you even jotted out a premature list of the women you want to be there standing by your side, long before you even met your fiancé. END
BEGIN HERE But what happens if midway through your wedding adventure, one of your bridesmaids isn't being supportive or isn't enthusiastic about this role you were excited to give them? Is it okay for you to ask them to step down from being a bridesmaid? Or are you supposed to sit silently as they spew out awkward tension on you and the entire bridal party? END
BEGIN HERE Bottom line: It's perfectly okay to "un-ask" someone to be your bridesmaid, but you need to have a good reason. Depending on how far along in the wedding adventure you're in, they probably spent a lot of time and money on being bridesmaid. So kicking them out will cause some hard feelings. After you've established a reason as to why you'd like to ask them to step down from being a bridesmaid, ask to meet with them or set up a phone call so that you can relay that information to them. Tell them that you feel, at this point, it would be better for them to just be a guest at your wedding, that the bridesmaid role is slowly ruining your friendship with one another. Once you're sure this is what you want to do, don't wait. The longer you wait, the harder it will be for you to have this conversation. END
BEGIN HERE  5 Qualities of a Good Maid of Honor END
BEGIN HERE The other thing to keep in mind is that if they've already bought the dress, it's the right thing for you to do to give them their money back, since the a tailored dress isn't refundable. END
BEGIN HERE So if you have a bridesmaid or two that are bringing you and the bridal party down, don't feel guilty about taking away bridesmaid duties from them. Just have a good reason and do it sooner, rather than later. END

BEGIN HERE Kelli Crubaugh first met Tobin Sio in January of 2009, shortly after she moved to Nashville, Tennessee, for work. Despite working together, it took Tobin eight months to gather the courage to strike up a casual conversation with Kelli. "My curly hair was actually the ice breaker," Kelli says. "We started talking regularly after that and have been officially together since January of 2010." After four years of dating, Tobin popped the question while the pair was on vacation to the Cayman Islands. END
BEGIN HERE Although both Kelli and Tobin call Nashville home, neither of their families hail from the famous city, so the bride and groom wanted to make sure their guests got the full experience. They planned a ceremony at a site where their family and friends could take in everything the city had to offer: John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge. "It's stunning and offers the best views of downtown," Kelli says. A reception followed at the Cordelle, where an open space proved to be a blank canvas that the couple could transform into their dream venue. Amy Nicole Photography was on hand for their May 9, 2015, celebration and captured every lively element of this unique wedding. END

BEGIN HERE In the middle of the pedestrian bridge, Kelli and Tobin exchanged vows they wrote themselves. During the proceedings, a blue heron, which Tobin and his family associate with the groom's late grandfather), flew past the couple. "It was such a special and significant moment," says the bride.

BEGIN HERE A major celebrity, marrying a civilian? No, we're not talking about Matt and Luciana Damon (why can't that happen to us?) — we're Throwback Thursday-ing it all the way to the original teen heartthrob and his non-celebrity love, Elvis and Priscilla Presley. END
BEGIN HERE Picture this: It's December 1966, Elvis Presley, the world's biggest entertainer — think Justin Timberlake, George Clooney, and Brad Pitt all rolled into one! — is in love and ready for marriage! After a 7-year courtship — the couple met while Elvis was stationed in Germany in 1959 — the King would propose to his 21-year-old love, Priscilla Ann Beaulieu, with a 3-carat diamond ring. It's ironic that Las Vegas is home to the Elvis impersonator wedding officiant, as Elvis and Priscilla would choose Sin City as the location for their May 1, 1967 "I dos." To throw wedding-hungry reporters off the scent of their pending nuptials, Elvis, Priscilla and their entourage flew from Palm Springs to Las Vegas by private jet at 3 a.m. At 4 a.m. the couple would secure their marriage license, and by 9 a.m. they were married. END

BEGIN HERE Surrounded by 14 of their nearest and dearest, Elvis and Priscilla pledged their love to each other in an 8-minute civil ceremony held in a private suite at Las Vegas's famed Aladdin Hotel. Priscilla's sister Michelle served as maid of honor, while Elvis's closest friends, Marty Lacker and Joe Esposito, apparently members of the Memphis Mafia, stood by the King's side as co-best men. Interestingly enough, the one request Elvis would make at the ceremony was to remove the word "obey" from the marriage vows. The bride was gorgeously '60s in a roomy (more on that later) white organza gown with long lace sleeves, all topped with her now iconic bouffant hairdo and a three-quarter length veil held together by a crown of rhinestones. As for the King, he kept it classic in a black tuxedo also topped with his iconic pompadour. END

BEGIN HERE After a press conference, it was time to celebrate. The reportedly $22,000 wedding reception drew around 100 guests, and it wasn't without frills — a $3,200 six-tier wedding cake, $10,000 worth of roast suckling pig, Oysters Rockefeller, lobster, Southern fried chicken, and of course champagne. All at 9 a.m. "The cake itself was a yellow sponge cake," Aladdin Hotel pastry chef Denis Martig told People about the iconic wedding. "Each layer was filled twice with apricot marmalade and a kirsch [liqueur] flavored Bavarian cream ... glazed with fondant icing and decorated with royal icing and marzipan roses." END
BEGIN HERE The couple's first dance? "Love Me Tender," of course. Hey, we all get a little narcissistic on our wedding day, right? END

BEGIN HERE      Photo: Getty Images    END
BEGIN HERE As for that roomy dress? Well, the couple welcomed their only child, Lisa Marie Presley, exactly 9 months after their wedding. Honeymoon baby much? Oh right, the honeymoon! The Presleys took to a Palm Springs home, now dubbed the "Elvis Honeymoon Hideaway" to celebrate their new union (you can still tour the Presley's "Honeymoon Hideaway" today), before heading back to Memphis and recreating their wedding day for friends and employees at Graceland.  END
BEGIN HERE The couple that made the whole world swoon, sadly divorced in 1973 but love still holds tender for Priscilla decades after Elvis's death. "But Elvis was absolutely the love of my life, and there's no sadness about it because I have my memories, and they're delicious and they're all mine," Priscilla told the Daily Mail in 2012. END
BEGIN HERE Ever feel like you have to walk on egg-shells when it comes to talking to your in-laws? If so, join a very uncomfortable and large club. "The in-law relationship can be so delicate, especially when it is relatively new," warns John Duffy, Ph.D., licensed clinical psychologist and author of The Available Parent. "It is a strange venture, welcoming someone new into their family. And it takes a balance that often requires decades to establish and feel steady. So, it is critical to choose your words carefully with your in-laws." END
BEGIN HERE Before you can speak freely, unafraid of judgment or other unintended consequences, Duffy says, "you have to achieve a balance between expressing your individuality with letting them know you are not staging a coup — you are not attempting to take over and control their family." And if you don't watch your words before you strike that perfect accord, you could put off your in-laws for good. END
BEGIN HERE "Early impressions are so powerful, and can have deep and lasting impact," Duffy says. "That's why it is so important to attend to, and really get to understand, the nature and dynamic of the family you are marrying into. The more you understand the culture of the family, the less likely you are to make a verbal misstep that may be misconstrued and poison future interactions." END
BEGIN HERE But even without that deep understanding of your newfound family, you can avoid spoken land mines, Duffy says. Here are five things you should never, ever say to your in-laws. END
BEGIN HERE   Sounds like something no one would ever say? Think again. "I've worked with in-laws who have been told statements like this, early in the relationship," attests Duffy. "They tend to find this insulting to their parenting style, and it's very tough to recover from this strong an insult." END
BEGIN HERE Additionally, Duffy stays, it's smart to steer clear of any talk about money, religion and politics. "Over time, of course, you can let your views be made known," he says. "But if you are overbearing on any of these subjects early on, you may be suggesting the idea that you are going to be difficult or preachy." END
BEGIN HERE We know an engagement ring selfie when we see one. Or at least we thought we did... When Nicki Minaj snapped a slew of photos back in December of her big (and we mean big) diamond sparkler, we were instantly hearing wedding bells for her and her boyfriend for over a year, rapper Meek Mill. And why wouldn't we be? The impressive bling Minaj couldn't help but show off practically screamed engagement ring, with its stunning stone and the fact that it occupied that finger. We were expecting our invitation in the mail any day now, but unfortunately, it looks like we might have to wait a little longer for these two to tie the know. On her recent talkshow appearance, the "Anaconda" singer gave us an engagement update and it's not exactly what we expected. END
BEGIN HERE Show off a sparkler that gorgeous and it's guaranteed to get people asking some questions — especially talkshow hosts! Ellen DeGeneres couldn't help but ask just what that big bling meant when Minaj appeared on her Wednesday show. "First of all, that's not an engagement ring," the singer stated. But before you totally lose hope, Minaj further explained the situation with her sweetheart. END
BEGIN HERE "I have two rings from this boy that likes me. That's not my engagement ring though," she said. "He said that that's my second ring and that if I get a third ring that that would be the engagement ring." Three rings?! Minaj is one lucky soon-to-be bride-to-be! END
BEGIN HERE  Our Favorite Celebrity Engagement Rings END
BEGIN HERE And of course DeGeneres said what we're all thinking. "That boy has money," the talkshow host hilariously quipped. (One look at the epic rock and there's no denying that!) But it sounds like the "Super Bass" singer isn't letting sheer carat count get in the way of what's important. In fact, when DeGeneres asked about the size of her not-yet- engagement ring, Minaj remained tight-lipped. "No matter how great your life is, you can't even impress people," Minaj said of the ring and her romantic relationship. "You just have to do you and make yourself happy and forget about trying to get everyone's approval. It's better just to keep those things sacred." END
BEGIN HERE Does this mean Minaj and Meek Mill will be the next celeb couple to hop on the secret celebrity wedding train? All we have to say is, she better give us a peek at that third (!) ring, first! END
BEGIN HERE Every bride remembers the moment the love of her life got down on one knee and proposed — she might not recall exactly what he said or what she was wearing, but that second in time will stay with her forever. But what she doesn't know about are the weeks, months, or even years leading up to that proposal from the other side: her groom's perspective. Here, in a new BRIDES series, our very own groom-to-be,  END
BEGIN HERE Rachel said her ETA was "no later than 8:30," so I figured I would play it totally safe and have everything set by then. Nobody is ever at the frozen yogurt place, so I figured the trip would last no longer than five minutes round-trip. Naturally on this night, the line was out the door when I arrived. END
BEGIN HERE Panic started setting in, realizing how long it was going to take to get the yogurt. I texted Rachel asking what time she thought she'd be home, but the iMessage went through as an SMS, which led me to believe her phone was dead. I reached out to her mom, asking her to call Rachel just to see if her phone was in fact dead. Her mom told me it went straight to voicemail. So here I am in a 20-person line at a frozen yogurt store, five minutes before I thought my girlfriend would be getting home, with no way of knowing when she would actually be home. END
BEGIN HERE On top of that, I had lit candles in the apartment before I left. If Rachel somehow beat me home, not only would my proposal plan be ruined, but I would be getting a much-deserved earful for being so irresponsible with fire. END
BEGIN HERE I bit the bullet and waited in line, sprinting back to the apartment at the cost of a few chocolate chips whose sacrifice will not soon be forgotten. Fortunately, she was not home yet. Still, I had no way of knowing when she would be getting back and there were frozen desserts in play. They went in the freezer and I deadbolted the door, thinking it would buy me a few extra seconds to full-on parkour when I heard her keys. END
BEGIN HERE For about 30 minutes I sat on the couch, getting progressively more nervous and out fear that she could be home any second, unable to calm my nerves by playing Xbox (yes, that is a thing). END
BEGIN HERE Finally, I got a text from Rachel. Dinner had just wrapped up, she had her phone on airplane mode because it was almost dead and she was on her way home. That gave me about 20 minutes. On her way home, Rachel called her mom, who began texting me location updates. After a few minutes, one read "she's walking into the building." END
BEGIN HERE I put the ring box in my back pocket, took the ice cream and frozen yogurt out of the freezer and got into position. Then, Rachel knocked on the door. I had to laugh out loud at the fact that she was too lazy to dig for her keys. END
BEGIN HERE She came into the dimmed apartment with a bag full of leftovers and began listing off what kind of food she had brought home for me. No comment yet on the candles, flowers or desserts. END
BEGIN HERE "I need a glass of water," said Rachel as she went for the cabinet and fridge, still seemingly unaware of her surroundings. END
BEGIN HERE Finally, she stopped and noticed the tray, as well as the fact that I was in a button-down shirt rather than sweatpants. "What's all this?," she asked between sips of water. Incredibly amused by this situation unfolding in front of me, I grinned wide and grabbed Rachel — by the hand, pulling her away from the kitchen. END
BEGIN HERE I got down on one knee in the middle of the living room. END
BEGIN HERE "Oh hello," she said, her voice cracking, as she began to realize what was happening. END
BEGIN HERE I hadn't really thought about if I should be holding the ring out while talking, so it remained in my back pocket as I held Rachel's hand and showered her with reasons that I love her. END
BEGIN HERE Finally, I took out the ring and popped the question: "Will you marry me?" END
BEGIN HERE Tears were streaming down her face as she said "yes" and I slipped it on her finger. END
BEGIN HERE I popped up, we shared a long kiss and then a huge hug. In the middle of heavy breathing, she loudly dropped an F-bomb and I don't think anyone will ever be happier to hear profanity than I was in that moment. END
BEGIN HERE "Can I look at the ring?" END
BEGIN HERE It never occurred to me that she hadn't actually checked out the bling. Rachel looked down, dropped another loud expletive and asked me if I was crazy. END
BEGIN HERE We moved to the couch, where the ogling continued for a few more minutes before deciding it was time to share the news. FaceTime calls with our parents resulted in tears on the other end, as well as more expletives when she held her hand up to the camera on my laptop. END
BEGIN HERE My mom reminded me of a fact that I had totally forgotten — the diamond belonged to my great-grandmother before my grandmother. END
BEGIN HERE Texts were sent to friends, which meant our phones were blowing up for a while, as we fielded congratulatory calls. After a while, we put our phones down and retired to the couch so that we could absorb this monumental event. It was an hour later, and we still hadn't caught our collective breath. END
BEGIN HERE Neither of us could stop smiling, and getting words out was a challenge as we sat there. END
BEGIN HERE "Well, I was going to come home and tell you how much my day sucked," Rachel said. END
BEGIN HERE It was about 12:30 when we finally went to bed, pillow-talking for another two hours because there was no way either of us was would be able to sleep. END
BEGIN HERE The engagement became "Facebook official" in the morning and we each spent the day rolling our eyes and texting each other as countless people asked if we had set a date yet. END
BEGIN HERE Our wedding is no longer a hypothetical and after a week of bliss, we're just starting to dive into the hard part: planning for October 2017. END
BEGIN HERE For bride-to-be, Eva Longoria, her wedding planning process has already gotten a little bit nosey! The talented actress is revealing her most memory triggering scents, and the floral aromas she's choosing for her wedding day. END
BEGIN HERE Who knew that this Desperate Housewives alum had such as specific nose for lavish scents? During a recent celebration for Elizabeth Taylor's legendary White Diamonds perfume, the newly engaged Longoria, couldn't help but reveal some of her most memorable fragrance moments, PeopleStyle reports. In reference to the occasion, Longoria shared her thoughts on the first fragrance she ever owned, White Diamonds. "I remember saving my allowance for a White Diamonds," said the L'Oréal brand ambassador, "I loved the bottle, and I remember it was such an aspirational thing to own." END
BEGIN HERE When it came to matters of the heart, the Telenovela star touched on the personal fragrance that best reminds her of her fiancé, Jose Antonio Baston. The actress shared that even though her sweet smelling fiancé constantly rotates his daily cologne, there's one scent that always seems to stand out. "He wears different ones so it's hard — it's definitely musky," shared Longoria, adding, "When I smell his aftershave or the cologne he uses...I think it's sexy for a man to have a signature smell. I veto some!" joked the future Mrs. Baston. "I don't influence the choice, but I veto the bad ones. I have veto power." END
BEGIN HERE But it was the A-lister's wedding day scent confession that peaked our senses! When asked of the fragrance she imagined for the biggest day of her life, the Golden Globe nominated actress said, "Jasmine and gardenia, like fresh flowers." Sounds like the perfect scent for a spring wedding! END
BEGIN HERE See More: Our Favorite Celebrity Engagement Rings END
BEGIN HERE Longoria also went into detail on the best-smelling place she has ever visited. "I love the smell of the Park Hyatt Paris-Vendôme," shared the Texas native. "They have their own fragrance pumped through the hotel, and one time they gave me a bottle because they don't sell it. I spray it in my bedroom. Not in my home — just in my bedroom." END
BEGIN HERE Longoria, who confirmed her engagement to her longtime love after a swoon worthy Dubai proposal just months ago, recently commented on the fact that her and her groom-to-be, already refer to each other as husband and wife! The actress told Us Weekly that she and Baston have "been calling each other husband and wife for a while." Longoria confessed that "The word fiancé feels like I got demoted. We feel married." END
BEGIN HERE Needless to say, we can't help but remain a little nosey when it comes to this adorable couple's sweet scented wedding day plans! END
BEGIN HERE Marriage is an amazing, wonderful roller coaster. Seriously, we can't express enough just how awesome it is, or how many myriad benefits it offers — so we're letting our married readers do it for us. Here, eight married men and women get real about what they love most about being married. END
BEGIN HERE   "I love the security in partnership. My husband is my true partner and he stands by my side or carries me through anything that life has thrown at us. We have lost a child, moved states, and are currently going through a high risk pregnancy. Not once have I felt alone or overwhelmed. We step up when needed and never keep score. Nothing is impossible with him by my side." — Shreeda END
BEGIN HERE Here's a wedding venue you've probably never thought of — the ocean! END
BEGIN HERE Not so for French world-champion free-diver Pierre Frolla, who wed Mara Demurtas in an underwater ceremony last July 4, in Monaco. The small European country, which is home to some of the world's wealthiest individuals, is no stranger to stunts — the famed Casino de Monte-Carlo has served as the set for James Bond films like "Casino Royale" — but stunt this was not. The underwater affair was followed up by a civil ceremony the next weekend, as French law dictates that couples must be wed by a local official for the marriage to be considered legal. END
BEGIN HERE The seaside event did have one very notable guest in attendance: Prince Albert II, son of Rainier III and Grace Kelly (possibly the most beautiful bride in history), who is a friend of the groom. While the crown prince opted for snorkeling gear, instead of a scuba tank, the majority of the 60-some guests were fully submerged for the ceremony, which took place in the water off Larvotto beach and included a red carpet on the ocean floor. END
BEGIN HERE If this sounds up your alley, good news: it's now possible to arrange your own underwater wedding in Monaco (or proposal — they even hide the ring in a shell). The cost to do so isn't cheap (6,500 euros, including taxes), but includes everything you need for the two to three hour ceremony: boat transfer and diving equipment for the couple, 22 guests, certified staff, and (fake) priest, as well as music, a Champagne toast, appetizers, and a video to commemorate the event. END
BEGIN HERE Still not convinced? Take Frolla's word for it: "It was the most beautiful day of my life. I highly recommend everyone get married 40 feet underwater!" END
BEGIN HERE For more information, visit Pierre Frolla; contact Frolla to book! END
BEGIN HERE Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan-Tatum have just reached a whole new level of perfection — hard to believe we know! The two are red carpet staples, Lip Sync Battle champions, and all around jokesters. So, when Drake name dropped Tatum in his new song Dewan-Tatum had to respond (and she did so perfectly we might add). END
BEGIN HERE Drake's new song "Pop Style" features the slightly cheesy lyric "Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum." Most people would probably laugh to themselves and then move on but the Supergirl actress isn't like most people. She instead responded with the perfect throwback pic of her hubby sporting a massive gold chain and (lucky for everybody) no shirt. She tagged the "Views From the 6" rapper in her hilarious pic (below) but he has yet to respond. END
BEGIN HERE We can't imagine Tatum is too upset about being mentioned in the Drake song or about his slightly embarrassing throwback pic. This isn't the first time we've seen the Magic Mike actor's abs and we hope it isn't the last. END
BEGIN HERE The Tatums have never been shy about teasing one another, the couple famously went up against each other on Lip Sync Battle and Dewan-Tatum couldn't help but poke fun at her hubby's stripper alter ego. END
BEGIN HERE The former professional dancer perfectly executed Tatum's Magic Mike XXL dance to "Pony" right down to the drawn on six-pack. The dance was already raunchy enough (did you see Dewan-Tatum work that electric drill?) but she even out did her husband's performance when she pulled him on stage for a lap dance. Just another typical night at the Tatum house... END
BEGIN HERE Dewan-Tatum totally would have taken home that champion belt if Tatum hadn't brought out his secret weapon — Beyoncé herself. Queen B graced the stage during Tatum's rendition of "Who Run the World," and everyone knows you don't go up against the Beyhive and expect to win. Aside from the surprise Beyoncé appearance no one was really surprised to see these two take on such impressive moves on the Spike show. They did meet on the set of Step Up after all. END
BEGIN HERE It's hard to resist the appeal of a good monogram. Those swirling letters would look gorgeous on anything from your wedding invitations to that new tote you've been eyeing — and of course, now that you're engaged, it's time to stock up on monogrammed items featuring your married name! But should you use your new monogram before you're actually married? Here's what our experts think. END
BEGIN HERE Etiquette states that you should save your new monogram (featuring your married last name) until after you are married. That means that the robe you'll wear while you get ready should have your maiden name in the monogram, while the beach bag you're buying for your honeymoon can have your new monogram on it, instead. END
BEGIN HERE Hoping to use a monogram on your invitations? Consider a monogram that includes an ornate ampersand between your first initials, instead of your fiancés last initial. Use this on the invitations, your wedding website, and the ceremony programs. You could also have a second, coordinating monogram featuring your married name that is debuted after the ceremony. Use it on anything from menus and cocktail napkins to your wedding cake and thank you cards. Have them created by the same designer so that they fit together seamlessly. END
BEGIN HERE The one exception to saving your married monogram until after you've signed the marriage license is for anything monogrammed that you'll be registering for. Specify your married monogram (both of your first initials, plus the first letter of your new last name) so that any of those personalized items feature the monogram you'll have (and share!) for the rest of your lives. END
BEGIN HERE Not the traditional type? Then don't worry about it! If your last name is Brown and his is Smith, there's nothing wrong with wearing a "Mrs. Smith" robe on your wedding morning, and the same goes for your monogram. Having your new monogram on your invitations (instead of your first initials with an ampersand) might not be the norm, but you're making a huge commitment to one another, so why not start now? END
BEGIN HERE Fiancé a sports fanatic? Then you may not want to get hitched smack dab in the middle of football season. Early or mid May wedding date sound great today? Well, be prepared because your wedding anniversary just might fall on Mother's Day down the line. Don't say we didn't warn you! With so much to consider when picking the perfect day to say, "I do", most brides and grooms completely forget the fact that this date will be important not only the year of, but every year after that one too. We talked to a few planning pros to break down exactly how your wedding date can impact your future. We suggest you listen up! END
BEGIN HERE   What if your wedding date could actually affect your future together? It does, according to famed astrologer Magi Helena. "In fact, scientific research into more than 10,000 wedding dates found conclusive evidence that the date you get married will have a powerful and predictable effect on your future love and happiness, peace and protection and success in both of your careers." Basically, certain planetary alignments are present in the astrology of the wedding dates of long-term happily and successfully married couples, like Cate Blanchett, Sarah Jessica Parker and Meryl Streep for example. So if you're into that sort of thing, do some research of your own and see if you can pick a MAGIcal Wedding Date (based off Magi astrology) too. END

Hathaway welcomed her first child, a baby boy, with her actor/producer husband Adam Shulman on March 24 (way to keep it under the radar, guys!), according to Glamour. And we can't get enough of his cute, classic name. END
BEGIN HERE Jonathan Rosebanks Shulman. So sweet! END
BEGIN HERE The couple tied the knot in 2012 and, two years later, Hathaway admitted that she was looking forward to having children with Shulman. "I'm the only one here who's not a mother," Hathaway said in a roundtable of actresses and mothers. "I hope to join the ranks soon. I'm thinking about that [the paparazzi] because I really want to have a baby, and my husband and I are like, 'Where are we gonna live?'" END
BEGIN HERE Earlier this year, The Intern star showed off her pregnancy glow on the red carpet with her husband at the L.A. Art Show and Los Angeles Fine Art Show's 2016 Opening Night premiere party. The event, hosted by the then soon-to-be-parents, benefitted St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The star spoke to People about the importance of the child-centered cause. "The first time I went to St. Jude Children's was 12 years ago," she told the magazine. "It was a place that I had heard about but after I saw it firsthand, I knew that my life had changed and that I would do anything to help those kids and their families, and I would do anything to support this cause."

BEGIN HERE Shortly after the star's pregnancy was confirmed late last year, Hathaway took to her Instagram to bare her growing belly with a cute beachside photo of the expectant actress in a red bikini. "Happy 2016 to my beautiful Instafriends! So, posting a bikini pic is a little out of character for me, but just now while I was at the beach I noticed I was being photographed," she explained in the photo's caption. "I figure if this kind of photo is going to be out in the world it should at least be an image that makes me happy (and be one that was taken with my consent. And with a filter :)" As if the always-gorgeous Hathaway needed a filter... END

BEGIN HERE Like so many couples do, Ray and Robin met at the office. "Ray was my boss!" Robin says. "We kept our relationship hush-hush until I left the company to start GATHER Events, a wedding and event company, in 2010." After that, they could finally share their love with the world and, in May of 2013, they spent a weekend in Joshua Tree National Forest with their pup, Hazel — the same place where they'd had their first weekend getaway a few years earlier — and Ray took advantage of the special location. With a little help from Hazel, he asked Robin to be his wife. END
BEGIN HERE Robin knows all there is to know about planning a wedding, but made a point to trust her team and enjoy being a bride. She and Ray are known for their festive backyard bashes, so they sought a venue that would allow them to create the same vibe, but for 100 people instead of a dozen. On June 14, 2014, they wed at Studio 1342 in Los Angeles, creating a colorful mid-century Mexican wedding fiesta! They brought in some of Robin's favorite and most talented connections in the industry, including photographer Braedon Flynn, who captured every vibrant detail. END

She carried a voluminous bouquet of proteas and peonies in an array of playful colors. But there was a secret behind her oversized arrangement: It was actually a bunch of smaller posies tied together with silk ribbon. (Keep reading to find out why!) END

"We snuck away and shared our vows with each other in private, then read them again during the ceremony," says Robin. "I really cherish that moment we had together." END
BEGIN HERE A playful party wouldn't be complete without killer shoes. Robin's choice was a pair of glitter-covered Jimmy Choos. END
BEGIN HERE In addition to their wedding party, the couple had seven nieces and nephews help out with the ceremony. "They were our confetti kids, and covered the crowd with gold confetti as they walked down the aisle!" says Robin. END

BEGIN HERE Teen Mom 2 star Chelsea Houska's longtime love Cole DeBoer proposed to the reality star back in November, and now, five months, later Houska is finally sharing all the romantic details from that special day. Although the two were filming the newest season of the MTV show when DeBoer popped the question, the cameras weren't there to catch the special moment — but they did catch her sharing all the sweet details. END
BEGIN HERE According to Entertainment Tonight, during Monday night's episode the newly engaged Houska opened up to her mom about how DeBoer asked that big question. "He was acting weird. He was acting so weird," Chelsea said of her fiancé. "He took me to this spot he likes out in the woods, and he had me come out there. There was a whole bunch of trees and there were pictures of us three nailed up on there. I seriously covered my eyes and I was like, 'Holy st, is this really happening?!'" END
BEGIN HERE Hearing Houska detail the proposal just wasn't enough to satisfy us, so we're thrilled that she posted pictures of the actual proposal on her Instagram (below). "I'm so so happy @jakephotographysf was there to capture this amazing moment in November. I am so blessed with such an incredible man @coledeboer," Houska captioned the super sweet picture. END
BEGIN HERE DeBoer totally thought of everything. We're sure it's a coincidence, but their outfits are even perfectly coordinated with the gorgeous fall leaves. And can we just talk about how cute it is that her daughter Aubree was there for the special proposal moment? She totally had her "shocked face" down perfectly. END
BEGIN HERE Turns out, Houska's little girl shouldn't have been too surprised by DeBoer dropping to one knee — according to InTouch Weekly, he made sure to ask her for permission to marry Houska first! DeBoer got down on one knee with a round-cute solitaire diamond engagement ring that he designed himself. Yup, that ring is truly one of a kind and definitely made with love. END
BEGIN HERE The cameras may have not been around for the big engagement moment but we hope they're there for the entire wedding planning process. We already cannot handle how cute Aubree is going to look as a flower girl! END
BEGIN HERE It's that time of year — your refrigerator is filling up with wedding invitations, and between shower gifts and wedding gifts, well, your wallet is hurting. Don't worry — you're not alone! According to a 2016 survey by RetailMeNot, the average person spends anywhere between $45 to $195 on a wedding gift. But it's not as simple as that. Your relationship with the bride and groom often dictates how much you're willing to pay. Take a look at these country-wide averages, and the perfect gifts to match the budget: END

BEGIN HERE  Slightly surprised you even got an invite? Most people will spend between $45 on a present for an acquaintance, but go slightly higher for a coworker at $63 (maybe it's the fear of seeing them every day!). Writing a check to a coworker might feel awkward, but don't worry — it's easy to find a gift to fall into this bill: Look for something on their registry that they can use often and well, like a serving platter or gorgeous picture frame for their wedding photos.

BEGIN HERE A possible congratulations are in order for Lindsay Lohan! It might feel like just yesterday that the actress was starring as her own twin in the remake of The Parent Trap, but this little camper is all grown up. In fact, she might be engaged! After just five months of dating, Lohan, 29, is possibly set to wed 22-year-old Russian heir Egor Tarabasov. END
BEGIN HERE Tarabasov, whose father is a multimillionaire businessman, reportedly popped the question to the former Mean Girls star over the weekend. While at the 2016 Asian Awards in London on Friday night, the Daily Mail reports, the actress wore a ring that certainly looked suspicious — is that her engagement ring?! If you squint and glare at the photos above and below, that bling sparkling on her left hand definitely looks like it could be a diamond sparkler on that all-important finger! END
BEGIN HERE lindsay lohan engagement ring END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Getty Images    END
BEGIN HERE After meeting "through mutual friends at a party," reports the Daily Mail, Tarabasov and Lohan began dating. While five months is definitely a short courtship, it sounds like these two were on the marriage path. The Russian heir reportedly spent the holidays with the starlet and her family. END
BEGIN HERE While she's never walked down the aisle before, Lohan has been linked to some pretty famous men, including That '70s Show star and current-beau to Demi Lovato, Wilmer Valderrama. END
BEGIN HERE "I haven't known Egor for that long," Lohan told The Sun last month. "We've been together for about seven months. He is a great guy. I met him in the summer. I'm really happy." END
BEGIN HERE But don't credit Tarabasov for Lohan putting her party girl days — her probation officially ended in May 2015 — behind her. "That's the one thing in America they always have done with me. If I have ever been linked to someone, they always say, 'This guy is so good for Lindsay. Look at how he has changed her.' I am just like, 'F--k you,' because I have done this for me. I take care of myself and then they just set it up to fail," she said. "The smartest thing I have done for myself is making the move to London I came to London by myself. Being here is such a big deal. I didn't have anyone here at first." END
BEGIN HERE Tradition states that the bride doesn't host her own bridal shower, but instead the honor falls to a female family member or close friend. So while you get to sit back, relax, and enjoy the party, there are probably some things your hosts should know — but what? Here's what our experts think you should share with your bridal shower hosts as they start planning. END
BEGIN HERE The most important thing about planning a bridal shower? Making sure the bride is there! Let whoever will be hosting your shower know when you're available, whether you're going out of town or have a big work project coming up. Not sure who's hosting? Share a calendar with your mom and your maid of honor, since the shower hosts will most likely be contacting them to arrange the details. If you live far from home, talk to your mom about whether she was hoping to throw you a shower, then plan a trip home for the occasion. The date won't be a surprise, but you don't need to know any other details! END
BEGIN HERE You should also share a potential guest list with your shower hosts, including any friends, family members, and future in-laws that you'd like to include (along with their mailing addresses!). This way your aunt isn't guessing which of your friends are closer than others, and your college bestie isn't trying to navigate your list of cousins. END
BEGIN HERE  The Best NYC Breakfast Spots for a Morning Bridal Shower END
BEGIN HERE Even if you're leaving the event up to the hosts, you should mention if there are traditions you'd rather avoid. Does the mere thought of opening gifts in front of everyone make you totally embarrassed? Or maybe you don't think making wedding dresses out of toilet paper sounds particularly fun. Share what you'd like to skip to help ensure it's an event you absolutely love. END
BEGIN HERE And finally, let the host know if there are things you really need to know. A common request? To tell you where to be, when to be there, and what to wear. There's nothing worse than showing up for what you didn't know would be your bridal shower in your favorite yoga gear instead of a chic Little White Dress! END
BEGIN HERE The sad news just broke that David Gest, the ex-husband of Liza Minnelli, passed away earlier today in London. And while the 62-year-old was becoming quite the familiar face on the reality TV circuit, Gest was probably best known for the marriage between him and the famously flamboyant Liza Minnelli. While his friends and family mourn his passing, we're taking a look back at what first forced the reality star into the spotlight — the over-the-top, insane wedding between Liza Minnelli and David Gest. END
BEGIN HERE When we say, insane, we mean insane. Before Kim and Kanye, there was Liza and David. For her fourth wedding, Minnelli pulled out all the stops with a lavish affair that toted an 850-person guest list, crazy tabloid coverage, and an oh-so-chic Fifth Avenue venue. Oh, and Michael Jackson as best man. See? Told you it was insane... END
BEGIN HERE Michael Jackson and Elizabeth Taylor END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Getty Images    END
BEGIN HERE Before Gest was starring on Celebrity Big Brother, he tied the knot with Minnelli back in 2002 at New York City's Marble Collegiate Church. The bridal party was nothing short of a hodge-podge of celebs, with Elizabeth Taylor serving as maid of honor and the King of Pop as best man. "Even the stars were craning their necks," says John Barrett, Minnelli's hairstylist for the epic event, who gave the bride her inspired 'do, according to People. With Diana Ross, Mickey Rooney, Elton John, Barbara Walters, the Doobie Brothers, Anthony Hopkins, Joan Collins, and Mia Farrow all on the guest list, we could certainly see why! END

BEGIN HERE The bedazzled bride made her way down the aisle in an ivory crepe Bob Mackie, which Minnelli later covered up with a floor length white mink coat on her way to her reception at the Regent Hotel, where Natalie Cole crooned her father's iconic song "Unforgettable" to the newlyweds. But the most unforgettable part of the whole affair? The couple's first kiss! Just as over-the-top as the wedding itself, no could stop talking about Minnelli and Gest's just-wedded lip-lock. "He sucked her lips right out of her face!" remembers Joy Behar. Even Donald Trump found the need to comment. (When does he not?) "I have been to many weddings," he said. "And I have never seen a kiss like that before." END
BEGIN HERE 14 years later and, we must say, we've never seen a wedding like that, either! (Sorry, Kimye...) END
BEGIN HERE On their very first date, Andrew Westmoreland took a wrong turn on a winding road away from the waterfall that he was supposed to visit with Valerie Norman. While Andrew was stressed, Valerie kept her cool until they found the right direction — and the pair has balanced one another out ever since. "We met, fell in love, and knew we wanted to spend the rest of our lives together after only six months of dating," Valerie says. "It just worked. We always have had an amazing connection and mutual adoration for each other." END
BEGIN HERE For their May 23, 2015, wedding, the couple decided on a romantic-yet-modern bash. "I have always been a little more bohemian and love to travel, so I wanted a relaxed wedding on a beautiful beach," says the bride. "Andrew appreciates a really modern and polished atmosphere, so we combined those two visions and came up with an amazing concept." Their big day, held at the W Retreat & Spa in Vieques, Puerto Rico, was a vacation for the couple and their 35 guests. The resort would need little in the way of decoration to make the party stand out, which allowed Valerie and Andrew to focus on creating a relaxing experience for their loved ones. "It was important that everyone had a great time and treated it as a vacation, including us," Valerie explains. "We knew our guests were coming from all over the country so we wanted to pick a truly amazing destination spot with many activities that everyone would love. Our guests hit up the beach for swimming, paddle-boarding, snorkeling, and kayaking." END

It is extremely elegant and has almost a romantic, vintage feel to it." The illusion lace back only added to the gown's appeal. END
BEGIN HERE Valerie's bouquet was a loose mixture of white roses and stock, accented with a touches of dusty miller and greenery. But in her hair, Valerie wore a white orchid. "I kept everything very simple," she says. END

BEGIN HERE Personalized sandalwood fans, which doubled as favors, were displayed on white ceremony chairs for guests to use throughout the beachside ceremony. Valerie and Andrew exchanged vows on a grassy knoll nestled between two palm tress. "It was so beautiful that we didn't need a lot of decoration," Valerie says. "We had two floral arrangements on either side of us at the 'altar,' and a small bundle of flowers on the edge of each aisle chair. It was simple and beautiful." END
BEGIN HERE The bride and groom worked hard to write their own vows. "We each took it very seriously that the commitment is forever and we are in it together through our whole lifetime," says Valerie. "Our vows were truly from the heart and we said some pretty powerful promises to each other. I will always remember what we said that day." END
BEGIN HERE But despite having plenty of time to practice, Valerie says Andrew seemed nervous while reciting his heartfelt vows. "I grabbed his hand and felt such an overwhelming feeling of love for him," she says. "I was so excited and sure of being completely dedicated to him as his partner." END

"We were looking for a very organic, natural feel for our décor, including floral arrangements that would complement the inherent beauty of the beach location." END
BEGIN HERE Because both Valerie and Andrew maintain a Paleo diet, the couple offered guests an entirely gluten-free dinner menu. "The chef completely welcomed the challenge and they were incredibly accommodating," says Valerie, who recalls most in attendance selected the delicious surf-and-turf option. END

What matters is you are marrying the love of your life, as long you guys are both there at the altar truly committed and in love, that's all that truly matters." END

BEGIN HERE Whenever the process of planning your wedding feels like a nightmare from which you will never wake up, you can always fantasize about the honeymoon — the wonderful dream from which you will not want to wake up. END
BEGIN HERE Of course, like a wedding, a honeymoon has to be planned. But, unlike a wedding, you will have a partner who is not only willing to help, but eager. Yes, we're talking about your soon-to-be husband. END
BEGIN HERE The wedding was mainly your show — there were plenty of aspects that we didn't really care about, or that you had to coax us into commenting on. The honeymoon, however, is something that will receive our full attention. END
BEGIN HERE We dream about vacations the way you dream about receptions. We want adventure! We want romance! We want exotic locations in which to engage in enormous amounts of honeymoon sex! END
BEGIN HERE But what if he wants to go one place, and you have your heart set on another? END
BEGIN HERE Think of it this way: When you are planning the wedding, you have to make compromises, right? You have to defer, at least a little, to your family, your friends, to your fiancé's mom, etc. The wedding is a public event, involving lots of people, and, much as you may want to, you can't just order everyone around. END
BEGIN HERE The honeymoon is similar. Except it's not a public event, it's a private event between you and your husband — the first joint enterprise that you will undertake together as a married couple. You're mother has no say in it, your friends' opinions are irrelevant. The honeymoon is all on the two of you. END

BEGIN HERE  Thinking of a Honeymoom in Anguilla? Here Is Your Cheat Sheet! END

Your honeymoon is a success if you enjoy it. So relax, find a place you can both agree on, and get your honeymoon groove on. END
BEGIN HERE When it comes to her wedding dress, this rap star is getting "Fancy!" Having recently gone public on Twitter in defense of her fiancé, Nick Young's, now infamous cheating scandal, it seems as though singer, Iggy Azalea, is moving on to bigger and baby things! The bride-to-be couldn't help but gush about the details surrounding her future nuptials, and her own plans to for a little bundle of joy. END
BEGIN HERE It seems like just yesterday that this Billboard-topping Australian rapper was celebrating her engagement to her basketball-playing beau (who could forget that stunning yellow diamond ring?). Nearly a year later, it looks as if Hollywood's recent media magnets are already finalizing some of their big day's biggest details. The "Team" singer got cnadid during an interview with Extra's, Elvis Durand, and the topic of her custom wedding gown, Us Weekly reports. "Giorgio Armani is gonna make my dress," said the bride-to-be. "I asked and I didn't know if he would because he really hasn't made a lot of celebrity wedding gowns." The Aussie native also revealed her bridal style when it comes to design and refined elegance. "I'm just a fan of classic tailoring and I wanted my wedding dress to be timeless so I don't look ridiculous in 25 years when I'm showing my kids, like, 'Here's what mommy wore." END
BEGIN HERE When it comes to the topic of expanding the family, Azalea confessed that she's been gaining her fair share of parenting practice thanks to the frequent babysitting sessions with her fiancé's 4-year-old son, Nick Jr., whom the Lakers star shares with ex-girlfriend, Keonna Green, Us Weekly confirms. "Well, you know my fiancé has a son and he's four years old, so he's at our house all the time," Azalea revealed. The controversy crushing rapper also went on to reveal her, and her future son's, culinary connection. "I have a bond with him...He really likes cooking, so when he comes over we, like, cook mini pizzas or make, like, Rice Krispy treats, we do stuff like that together." Talk about absolutely adorable! END
BEGIN HERE  Which Celebrity Couple is Getting Married Next END
BEGIN HERE Surprisingly, the thought of having her own baby is not far off from Azalea's mind! The rapper went on to admit, "I think I have a little window into what it might be like to have my own child but I have so much to do. It's way in the future." END
BEGIN HERE Despite recent cheating allegations, this Twitter-loving twosome went public to ensure that all is good in love and pre-marriage. Young recently retweeted a TMZ article titled "Nick & Iggy Are Still Gettin' Hitched" to put fans and followers' minds at ease about their engagement status. END
BEGIN HERE Your wedding day is one of the few chances in life to really go all out. A goofy gift bag? Yes, please! A crazy-tough workout regimen? Why not! Continue the trend when you book your hotel suite. After all, there's only one first night as a married couple. You might as well spend it in one of these luxurious rooms to ensure it's a night you and your new hubs will never forget. END

BEGIN HERE Right after the bride spreads the word that's she is officially engaged, and she posts the picture of her beautiful diamond engagement ring, her close friends and family members will start to twiddle their thumbs and think to themselves: will I be asked to be the maid of honor? END
BEGIN HERE Being the maid of honor is a true honor. It's practically the role of a lifetime, and one that's unforgettable. You'll be the bride's go-to gal pal throughout the entire wedding adventure and stand right behind her as she says "I do." You'll also be there to help her with decisions along the way and give your opinion on what style dresses the bridal party should wear. END
BEGIN HERE But what should you do if you thought you were going to be the bride's maid of honor, but then she picks someone else? END
BEGIN HERE First, you should let yourself be upset. Be angry even. But do so in private. Try not to spread this confusion and emotion you have throughout the bridal party. If it will help you move on, chat with the bride and let her know you're disappointed she didn't pick you as the maid of honor, but you can't wait to support her as a bridesmaid. Don't make her feel bad about not picking you and instead, let her know that you'll be there for her. END
BEGIN HERE Next, promise yourself you won't take these hard feelings out on the maid of honor, even if you don't know why the bride picked her. Tell the MOH that you'd be happy to help her with whatever she needs. Choosing this kind of attitude over a stubborn and explosive one will be the only way you make it through the wedding without resenting the bride and the event altogether. END
BEGIN HERE Even if this is hard to do, and instead you want to ignore the MOH and not listen to a word she says, try and rise above this feeling. Don't take it personally that the bride didn't make you the MOH. If she means a lot to you, as a good friend, you'll find a way to put this past you and instead, be there for her and the bridal party in a mature and adult way. END

BEGIN HERE Your pretend BFF Amy Schumer kicked off her 2016 with an insanely successful movie — Trainwreck is totally our new favorite bachelorette weekend flick — and a new relationship. Schumer and her hottie boyfriend Ben Hanisch announced their relationship in January and have been heating things up ever since. The comedian even dished that they've already hit a major relationship milestone: Meeting the parents. END
BEGIN HERE During her Tuesday appearance on The Tonight Show, Schumer opened up to host Jimmy Fallon about her relationship with Hanisch. "We're great. We're really good," the Inside Amy Schumer star said. "We met and like totally fell in love and it's been really good, and it became viral Internet news. I think it's because he's really cute and people were like, 'What? Dating Amy? He has all his teeth!' Like, people were shocked," she joked, getting some raucous giggles from Fallon. "They were shocked." END
BEGIN HERE The A-lister and her furniture maker boyfriend (who is basically a real life Aiden Shaw) recently flew to Chicago so the Trainwreck star could meet his entire family. It sounds like Schumer might be the first celeb Hanisch has dated — the comedian hilariously recalled giving his family a heads up about paparazzi. ""I told them, 'Look, journalists are going to call you, because it's what they do. And they're going to come to the house,'" the actress, 34, said. "And they did." Hanisch's mom, Deb, played it cool when the journalist called, but she may have played it a little too cool. END
BEGIN HERE "I told her, 'Deb, they're going to call you. Just say 'no comment.' And she's like, 'Oh, I got it, Amy. Don't you worry. No comment. Not a problem,'" Schumer told Fallon. "Not even 10 minutes later I get a Google alert from TIME magazine that Deb was like, 'I've never heard of her before in my life!' Too far, Deb! Too far. You took it too far, Deb," the comedian joked, before sincerely adding. "She's so sweet." END
BEGIN HERE Eeek! Talk about an awkward situation with a potential future mother-in-law (hey, we're hoping for wedding bells here!). But brides-to-be, take note: Keep Schumer's playful attitude in mind the next time your MIL makes an awkward comment about your bridesmaid dress colors. END
BEGIN HERE The actress was able to laugh off Hanisch's mom's sweet attempt to play it cool. Now that Schumer's met the family and admitted the two are totally in love can we start hoping for some wedding news in the future? We're already dying to see Schumer's BFF Jennifer Lawrence as a bridesmaid! END
BEGIN HERE We know wedding planning can be a bit overwhelming, to say the least. One of the most important aspects of wedding planning is organization. Without organization, wedding planning can grow into a seemingly impossible, and super stressful task. To keep the fun in planning your big day (and to help keep you sane in the process), here are our best tips for staying organized throughout your wedding planning experience. END
BEGIN HERE   It's so easy to get overwhelmed with things to do while planning a wedding, but to avoid becoming disorganized (and super stressed) it's best to focus on one task at a time. Even the best multi-taskers will admit that it doesn't always work out in their favor, so why take a chance? By channeling your focus into single tasks, you're sure to be more productive, organized and relaxed. END
BEGIN HERE Before Jennifer Lopez turned into a highly-paid wedding singer (anyone remember her epic performance at the wedding of a Russian billionaire last month?), she was a three-time bride, herself, donning white wedding dresses and heading down the aisle toward waiter Ojani Noa in 1997, backup dancer Cris Judd in 2001, and then finally Marc Anthony in 2004. But will there be another round of "I do's" from J.Lo in 2016? Well, maybe... The singing superstar recently revealed that, despite her string of broken vows, she's totally open to tying the knot a fourth time. (Better get on it, Casper Smart!) END
BEGIN HERE Lopez has been dating her longtime love, Casper Smart, since 2011 and the pair has been topping our cutest red carpet couple countdowns ever since! But while we would love another peek at the lovely Lopez in a wedding dress, we're starting to wonder if these two cuties will ever put a ring on it. (It's been 5 years, after all!) But in a recent interview with W magazine, J.Lo explained the wedding bell holdup, stemming from lingering hurt feelings after her not-so fairytale marriage to Marc Anthony. "When my marriage ended, it was not easy to find forgiveness," she said. "It wasn't the dream that I had hoped for, and it would have been easier to fan the flames of resentment, disappointment and anger." END
BEGIN HERE  Jennifer Lopez Gives Pre-Wedding Party Style Inspiration on the Red Carpet END
BEGIN HERE But thankfully, it sounds like her current relationship with Smart has helped the Shades of Blue star move on — so much so that white dresses and tiered cakes are dancing in her head once again! "We got together and broke up and are now together again," Lopez said of her relationship with Smart. "I still think about getting married and having that long life with someone. I love the movie The Notebook. A dream of mine is to grow old with someone." END

BEGIN HERE There's a fine line between a wedding theme that brilliantly pulls everything together and one that's downright cheesy. On the plus side, nailing down a theme will set off a domino effect for your decision-making process. "Having a theme helps to create a sense of continuity and cohesiveness and often can be a good jumping-off point when starting your planning," says Celeste Fierro, senior vice president of The ONE Group and its STK restaurant brand. On the other hand, going overboard on kitschy décor can easily run you into tacky territory. Here are five tips on how to stay on the elegant side of the line. END
BEGIN HERE   So long as the day captures you and your groom, you'll avoid the "What was I thinking?!" moment 20 years from now. "As long as you choose a theme that has meaning for both you and your partner, then your wedding day will always be timeless," Fierro says. Fierro recalls seeing photos from a Batman-themed wedding, complete with comic book bouquets and dramatic lighting. Yes, even this will stand the test of time for this particular bride, Fierro says. "Above all, it's most important to not lose sight of who you are and who and what you love," she says. END
BEGIN HERE Choosing your wedding planner is an important decision — one of the most important in your wedding-planning journey, one could argue — as the person you hire will be helping create the most important day of your life, so far. So feel free to take your time and be a little picky when it comes to choosing the right one. Every planner should offer at least one free initial consultation in person, via phone, or via Skype, so you can get a sense of their personality, in addition to seeing examples available online. END
BEGIN HERE When you're talking to a potential candidate, ask the following five questions to get some important insight as to how they work: END
BEGIN HERE   This is one of the tricky interview questions that most planners won't expect, but if they're experienced, it shouldn't even phase them. Successful planners will regale you with stories about the brides and grooms they're using as references. Take note of these tidbits, because it gives you a jumping off point for a conversation with that couple when you contact them for a reference. END

BEGIN HERE There's more to hiring vendors for your wedding than just picking someone who provides the service you're looking for, has a style you love, and will show up on-time on your wedding day. You know you're supposed to tip them and feed them, but what about where your wedding vendors will stay once the party's over? Our experts weigh in on whether or not booking a hotel room for your vendors should be added to your to-do list. END
BEGIN HERE Whether or not you have to provide hotel rooms for your vendors depends on whether the wedding professionals you're working with are local, will have to drive to your venue, or are flying in from another part of the state or country. Does your planner live a few towns over? Chances are they'll drive home at the end of the evening. Are you getting married at a remote location, but your photographer is based out of the state capital? Even if he or she isn't contracted to shoot for the entire evening, you may be contractually required to book them a room nearby for the night. Flying in that amazing band you saw in Nashville? A few hotel rooms will definitely be required. END
BEGIN HERE Most vendors (particularly planners, photographers, and bands and DJs) have a travel and lodging fee outlined in their contract, which requires you to either pay an additional sum or cover their costs if you're asking them to travel beyond a certain distance from where they're based. It's usually in the same section where they outline requirements for vendor meals, but if you don't see it, just ask! You can also confirm how many rooms they'll need, especially for a band with a larger number of members — chances are all 10 band members don't need their own rooms, but they may ask for separate rooms for performers of different genders, or be totally fine sleeping four people in a room with two double beds. END
BEGIN HERE  How Many Accommodation Options Do You Have to Offer Traveling Wedding Guests? END
BEGIN HERE If you would like to (or are required to) provide lodging for some of your vendors the night of your wedding, you're not obligated to put them up in the same swanky hotel where the reception will be held. You will, however, want to pick a hotel that's nearby and easily accessible, and should confirm with your venue that the vendors' equipment (especially things like speakers, lighting, and instruments) can be stored somewhere safe for the night — this way they're not lugging everything across town unnecessarily.

BEGIN HERE After several years of long-distance dating, New Jersey native Alexis Panicali made the move to Oregon to be with boyfriend Nathan Trotta, so it was only fitting that he followed her back East a few years later. And once there, Nathan was ready to ask Alexis to be with him forever — but he didn't want to do it just once. "He actually asked me to marry him three times," the lucky bride says. "I said 'yes' to every one! At home, in a car, in my sleep; with my dream ring, an amazingly sparkly and gorgeous Edwardian-style, antique mine-cut diamond ring." END
BEGIN HERE The duo set the date for June 13, 2015, and started planning a celebration that would be unlike the many weddings the bride had attended before. "We knew that our dream ceremony was one that would allow us to have our feet in the grass, surrounded by nature, and was somewhat non-traditional compared to a typical catering hall-style wedding," Alexis says. The bride's father suggested Alexis and Nathan consider the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens, which immediately took the couple's breath away. With visions of an organic and blossoming bash, Alexis and Nathan dreamed up an ethereal wedding that was resplendent with wild flowers. END
BEGIN HERE The hardest part about planning their day? Choosing the right photographer. "We had a specific vision of how we wanted the day to be captured, but we also wanted someone who we connected with and felt comfortable with," Alexis says. Enter: Lev Kuperman.

"Because I chose that color for my bridesmaids, it was hard to choose a color for Nathan's groomsmen. Black seemed 'Halloween-y,' while navy just wasn't our style," Alexis says. In the end, the pale gray tuxedos were the perfect balance to the bold color. END
BEGIN HERE To keep things interesting, Alexis asked her florist to create an entirely different bouquet for each bridesmaid.

BEGIN HERE For most couples, announcing their engagement is one of the happiest celebrations they'll have — except for their wedding, of course. But for Keeping Up With the Kardashians star Rob Kardashian and his new fiancée Blac Chyna, it seems to have been quite the opposite. After announcing their whirlwind engagement less than a month ago (and after less than four months of dating), one of the Kardashian's closest confidants, Malika Haqq, is finally speaking out on behalf of the youngest Kardashian heir's milestone moment. END
BEGIN HERE If you do, in fact, frequently "keep up with the Kardashians," it's easy to recognize the name of one of the Kardashian squad's closest friends, and longstanding guest star on the hit reality show. Haqq, who also happens to be the newest member of the Hollywood Divas cast, recently opened up about the somewhat drama-filled engagement of her best friend, Khloe Kardashian's, younger brother, and his engagement to the estranged member of the famous family (Chyna is Kylie Jenner's current boyfriend, Tyga's, ex-girlfriend and mother to his son). "I actually haven't spoken to Rob," Haqq told E! News. "I saw him a couple of months ago. I get all the reports from his sister and his mommy." Even though the Kardashian BFF has yet to come face-to-face with the groom-to-be post-engagement, Haqq reveals that she knows him well enough to know that he's in a good place. "I know he's happy. He's a lover." END

Following the shocking announcement that the Chyna will change her name to Angela Kardashian post-wedding, things are quickly moving closer down the aisle. A source close to Chyna revealed that the bride-to-be "will have at least two dresses on her wedding, both statement pieces," E! News reports. Sources also revealed that the Kardashian fiancée-turned-fitness trainer (the future Mrs. Kardashian has since publicly announced that she's training her beau for the big day), even "has an idea on who she may want to design her dresses." It looks like these two aren't wasting any time when it comes to the details! END
BEGIN HERE As for the wedding party, can we expect to see the Kardashian-Jenner clan honoring their younger brother on his big day? With no recent comment from either party, a source did reveal the bride-to-be's alleged maid of honor choice (we can bet almost anything that it's not Kylie!). The coveted title will supposedly go to Chyna's BFF, Amber Rose, whom of which has publicly announced her support for the controversial twosome in a series of Instagram posts. END

The designer duds they could no doubt outfit the entire wedding party in, a gone-viral wedding video, and of course, the hunky male celeb she just might invite as her plus-one! The downside? She might bring a trail of paparazzi to the wedding reception. Oh well, the more wedding photographers the better, right? By now, we've all seen Taylor Swift's perfect performance as maid-of-honor at her best friend Britany Maack's wedding and heard her Grammy-worthy wedding toast. But, as it turns out, there were parts of that Pennsylvania wedding that even we didn't see. Someone who did? The Vogue reporter Taylor Swift brought along for the ride! END
BEGIN HERE The "Shake It Off" singer returned to her childhood home with a reporter in tow for the nuptials of her BFF back in February. Swift, who has known the bride since they were 10 days old according to Vogue, was an obvious choice for the role of lead bridesmaid. After seeing the photos of Swift and Maack, both decked out in Reem Acra and watching the video of her tearing-jerking speech, we thought we knew all there was to know about the sweet, hometown "I do's." But Vogue pulled back the veil on the nuptials with some surprising T. Swift tidbits. Like, did you know that the MOH used to have a crush on the groom?! Yup, the pop superstar was once infatuated with the kindergarten-aged groom back in the day, when he was "that kid who sat next to me in class with the bowl cut and the Lego lunch box," she admitted. END
BEGIN HERE Another wedding day fun fact? Amongst the churchgoers in the chapel where the bride and groom said their "I do's" were the very nuns that taught Swift's kindergarten class. (Yes, really.) Gotta love small towns! END
BEGIN HERE And just how did those hometown wedding guests react to the oh-so-famous maid-of-honor? Thankfully, just like she was any other bridesmaid. The newlyweds smartly enacted a no-phones rule at their ceremony and reception, which meant no T.Swift selfies were being snapped as she performed her bridesmaid duties — straightening the bride's train, high-fiving the other members of the bridal party, and fawning over her just-wedded friends. And of course she had them all laughing, crying, then laughing again with her now-highly-viewed maid-of-honor speech. END
BEGIN HERE  This Couple Got Married at a Taylor Swift Concert — Seriously! END
BEGIN HERE In fact you probably wouldn't even think the wedding's head bridesmaid was red carpet royalty, except of course for the Vogue reporter tailing her, who did manage to ask Swift the important question of the night (besides the whole, "Do you take this man..." thing, of course) — whether this whole white dress and tiered cake affair makes the singer think of tying the knot with her beau-of-the-moment, Calvin Harris. "I'm just taking things as they come," Swift shared. "I'm in a magical relationship right now and of course I want it to be ours, and low-key... This is the one thing that's been mine about my personal life." END

BEGIN HERE Sex outdoors can be a little (or a lot) risky. But despite the risk-factor, you may be considering getting down and dirty in the great outdoors on your honeymoon. END
BEGIN HERE "Honeymoon sex is often about being adventurous and hedonistic, because it's finally official: You're with the one you love, it's legal, and it's forever," says Gloria Brame, Ph.D., sexologist and author of The Truth About Sex: A Sex Primer For The 21st Century. "And those feelings of trust and security between partners is a better disinhibitor than alcohol, because it goes right down to the core of your emotional being." END
BEGIN HERE Not only that, but your honeymoon destination could offer up a veritable smorgasbord of sexy spots — from beaches to mountains and other natural wonders — where you could be intimate with your new spouse. "With your hormones on high and your trust issues at ease," says Brame, "getting naked and primal while feeling sweet breezes on your naked body can be truly ecstatic." END
BEGIN HERE But before you get buck naked in the great outdoors, there are a few keep-you-safe and sexy rules you should follow. END
BEGIN HERE   You should only get it on outdoors if both of you want to, Brame says. "If both of you are into it, you won't have any problems — you'll find that perfect spot and be able to jump all over each other with joy," she says. "But if one of you is terrified of being caught or frightened of the bugs, I recommend staying inside, throwing that blanket on the floor, pretending you're in a jungle and letting your animal nature come out indoors." END
BEGIN HERE Here at BRIDES we're total suckers for a good love story — who isn't? — and this latest viral video totally captured our hearts. We've seen our fare share of cute videos — from flash mobs to puppy proposals — and we thought we'd seen it all, until now. Animator Kevin Ulrich wanted to find an adorable way to surprise his then-fiancé Celina Frenn with a retelling of their love story, so, he did what he does best: animate it. END
BEGIN HERE Ulrich used Legos to quickly recap the story of how he and Frenn met and fell in love. And considering he's a talented artist who's worked directly with the Lego Group before, we aren't surprised that the video is such a hit. END
BEGIN HERE "The first six months of knowing each other was characterized by signs indicating that we should be together, and me staunchly resisting those signs because of bad experiences in the past," Ulrich told Buzzfeed. "Eventually I caved and said, 'You're worth the risk.'" Ulrich and Frenn started out as coworkers two years ago and as seen in the video, Ulrich had a strict no dating co-workers policy. END
BEGIN HERE "Her dad was one of our clients, and he and I did not get along very well, so I had a double reason for not wanting to ask her out," Kevin said. "But eventually I came to realize I would never find another girl like her, and the complications were worth the effort. Now we are no longer coworkers, and her dad and I are good friends." Maybe Ulrich can share some pointers on how to get through a bad first impression with the future in-laws. END
BEGIN HERE The cute clip walks through many real-life moments in the couple's relationship. Ulrich asking Frenn out in a tree is seriously too precious for words. (SPOILER alert: she said yes!) To top it all off, he even managed to perfectly recreate the moment he proposed, using Legos of course. END
BEGIN HERE The video took a total of 70 hours to make and was the perfect wedding day surprise — well, almost surprise. "In the weeks leading up to our wedding, Celina started asking about a video saying, 'Wouldn't it be great if you did a Lego video about us? You don't have to. But if you wanted to I would love it!' So I spilled the beans and told her I had been planning to, but had no way of keeping it a surprise. I told her to trust me and that she would like the final product. And she did. She loved it," Kevin said. Is there any girl that wouldn't love that?! END
BEGIN HERE After all of the fittings that take place once your wedding dress arrives, you should end up with one of the best-fitting garments you'll ever wear. Whether it zips, buttons, or ties in the back, you should feel secure, supported, and ready to dance the night away. But what if, after all that dancing, you can't get your dress off? Our experts have a few tips. END
BEGIN HERE Whether your zipper snagged on some of the lace on the bodice, the knot that held your corset in place would rival that of an experienced sailor, or an extra glass of champagne made those tiny buttons a serious challenge for your new hubby, the last thing you want at the end of the night is to be stuck in your wedding dress. But these things happen — and they happen a lot! — so don't panic. END
BEGIN HERE If wiggling won't loosen your zipper, try rubbing a little bit of bar soap just beneath the zipper to lubricate the teeth, then slowly wiggle and pull again. Vaseline or clear chapstick would also work, but since it's your wedding gown, try to avoid anything with a tint to it. Still can't get out? Reach for the scissors and very carefully cut as close to the zipper as you can. Be sure to cut the woven fabric that's attached to the zipper teeth, not the fabric or seams of your gown! END
BEGIN HERE Tied in to your corset? The good thing is, replacing the ribbon used to tie your gown won't be too much of an expense. Snip off the knot in question, unthread the ribbon, and you're free! END
BEGIN HERE  4 Wedding Dress-Alteration Blunders (And How to Fix Them) END
BEGIN HERE If buttons are the problem, use a trick that's also helpful for getting the buttons done in the first place: a crochet hook. Simply hook the buttonhole, then gently pull the fabric around and off of the button to release. Sure, it's a little labor-intensive, but it won't damage your gown at all. END
BEGIN HERE That's it, you're free! Take a deep (unrestricted!) breath, and swap your gown for the lightest, comfiest, silkiest pjs you can find. END
BEGIN HERE When it comes to bridal beauty, more and more designers are taking a soft, natural approach — especially at Marchesa, where elaborate, dreamy dresses steal the show. Here, three less-is-more beauty tips we learned from the pros that you'll love to implement for your big day. END

Do what hairstylist Kevin Hughes did: before creating this gorgeous braided chignon, he sprayed Moroccanoil Dry Texture Spray ($28, Moroccan Oil) throughout the hair, crimped it, brushed it out, and then began braiding. "Crimping your hair gives it volume and grip — and also helps it stay put," he says. END
BEGIN HERE Kalishabeta Esfandiari says she looked forward to her name getting a whole lot shorter when she finally married Stephen Reza Emami. Two years after meeting at San Francisco's North Beach Festival, the couple was getting ready to welcome their first son in November of 2014 when Stephen asked Kalisha to be his wife. He planned an unforgettable proposal while the pair enjoyed a much-deserved vacation on the Hawaiian island of Lanai. As the sun began to set, the pair met at Sweetheart Rock, a Lanai landmark, and Stephen reached into his pocket to pull out an engagement ring. END
BEGIN HERE Their adventure together continued on August 15, 2015, as guests watched the pair officially become husband and wife at the magical Calistoga Ranch in Calistoga, California. "My vision was fairly clear," Kalisha says. "I wanted a rustic location with a very feminine and classic look. I wanted organic chic, but still very elegant." The luxury resort was the perfect place for the couple and planner, Yasmin Ziacita of Floral Theory, to create a high-end look while maintaining the bride's desire for a rustic feel. Read on to see every stunning photo, as captured by Nirav Patel Photography. END

BEGIN HERE Kalisha says finding her wedding dress was one of the most difficult parts of planning the wedding. She traveled all over California and tried on 80 dresses before she found the perfect Delphine Manivet gown. She loved how comfortable her lace sheath was, and with the addition of a custom capelet made with extra fabric from the gown and a romantic lace veil, Kalisha knew she found her dreamy, vintage look. "I felt beautiful, comfortable, and confident", the bride says. END
BEGIN HERE Kalisha's two best friends served as her bridesmaids. "Luckily we all have the same taste, so finding their dresses was so easy", the bride said. The group decided on neutral-hued flowing gowns with customizable necklines. Kalisha added a personal touch by ordering each bridesmaid a gold necklace spelling out their respective Instagram usernames. END
BEGIN HERE Stephen looked shark in a midnight blue tuxedo from Gucci, which he paired with Tom Ford patent leather boots. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Nirav Patel Photography    END
BEGIN HERE The bride and groom chose to be married underneath beautiful budding trees and an arch made of baby's breath. Kalisha and her father walked down the aisle while a live guitar and violin duo performed "Meditation" by Antonio Carlo Jobim. END
BEGIN HERE "My maid of honor did a reading, but we wanted to keep the ceremony short, so we chose basic wedding vows," Kalisha says. The newlyweds left the secluded space arm in arm as the musicians performed "Pour Toujours." END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Nirav Patel Photography    END
BEGIN HERE After taking in the view from the couple's their breathtaking ceremony, guests moved to the pool to watch synchronized swimmers put on a show. "I fought hard for the swimmers, we were actually the first to have anything like that at Calistoga Ranch," Kalisha says. END

BEGIN HERE Kalisha, Stephen, and their loved ones all sat at long farm tables arranged on the property's Lommel Lawn for the three-course dinner. Centerpieces were comprised of intricate greenery runners that were studded with roses and dahlias. Small candles were sprinkled throughout to provide a dreamy glow to the reception. END
BEGIN HERE Each place setting included a patterned charger, gold flatware, and a chic black and white printed menu which detailed the evening's meal selections, including an heirloom tomato panzanella, risotto, halibut, and filet mignon. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Nirav Patel Photography    END
BEGIN HERE After dinner, dessert was served in the property's Wine Cave, a modern white and gold lounge area. Along with an assortment of cookies, the couple served a square-shaped tiered chocolate wedding cake filled with vanilla buttercream. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Nirav Patel Photography    END
BEGIN HERE The intimate interior space proved to be the perfect spot to keep the party going. Guests danced to music by Sarah Lawrence, an LA-based DJ that the couple flew in for the occasion. "She didn't play typical wedding music," the bride says. END

Y'all better start preparing yourself for endless maternity style inspiration. END
BEGIN HERE During Blake Lively's first foray into motherhood, she served up the chicest mother-to-be looks we've ever seen.

So we decided to find out. END

(We limited our search to current stars and skipped Miami (which Andy Cohen has called "dead in the water") as well as D.C., which is off the air, and Potomac and Dallas, which just debuted.) One weird commonality from coast to coast: Round-cut center stones are by far the most popular, probably because they're widely regarded as the sparkliest, and all of these ladies love sparkle. END

BEGIN HERE When Rob Kardashian first slipped that engagement ring — an enormous diamond bauble, if you need reminding — on Blac Chyna's finger, big ball gown wedding dresses and faraway wedding venues began dancing in our heads. Chyna's soon-to-be sister-in-law tied the knot in an epically extravagant Italian destination wedding after less than a year long engagement, after all! So this bride-to-be couldn't be far behind in planning an over-the-top bash, right? Well, Blac Chyna and her to-be hubby just shocked us with their unexpected wedding plans. They're definitely not what we'd thought they'd be... END
BEGIN HERE The to-be-wed twosome certinaly has a lot to smiling about, considering their engaged status and baby on the way, and have been celebrating their Memorial Day weekend in Las Vegas, marking the holiday, their engagement, and their pregnancy. "Rob and I are having a great time celebrating with our friends and family," Chyna shared with Entertainment Tonight. And although she has had an infamous rocky start with the Kardashian clan, Chyna has apparently smoothed things over with her almost in-laws. "Everyone's happy!" she said. "Things with Rob's family are fantastic." We're not surprised — nothing brings people together quite like engagement rings and joyous baby news! But what is surprising us are the couple's wedding plans — or lack thereof. END
BEGIN HERE "We're taking things slow," the bride-to-be revealed, explaining that her and Kardashian are in no rush to walk down the aisle. While we were envisioning a big — and quickly planned — bash, the pair has been taking a more laid back approach to their big day details. "I'm just chilling and making sure she's straight," Kardashian added. Very laid back, indeed... END
BEGIN HERE But despite the couple's current lack of plans, we're still hoping for an over-the-top soirée. Blac Chyna is a to-be Kardashian, after all. And if there's one thing we know for sure, it's that those ladies like their weddings big, bold, and oh-so-beautiful. END

BEGIN HERE At most weddings, the the best man typically claims the "best toast of night" honors. His speech tends to be a mix of roasting the groom, as well as a few good-hearted sentiments for the new couple. And while the maid of honor gives a toast as well, it usually veers towards the standard, sweet script (read: forgettable) to ensure there are no hurt feelings — but it doesn't have to be that way! The MOH's speech can (and should!) be just as fun, heart-warming, and if not more memorable's than the guys. It just takes some thought. Here, a quick guide to stealing the show with your toast. END
BEGIN HERE   You're likely giving a speech because you've been extremely close to the bride for a long time. Of everyone at the wedding, you have the best insight of how much the groom has changed your friend (hopefully for the better — if not, find some way in which for the better!). Your speech needs to be about the friend you knew long before the groom, and then pivot to what role the groom has played in your friend's life. Maybe she's even funnier now thanks to her new husband's sense of humor or his support has empowered her to take risks in new ways. END
BEGIN HERE The point is that your toast should have an arc. Here's a quick outline: END
BEGIN HERE  - "This is who my friend has always been."  - "Then she met the groom."  - "And not only is my friend still fantastic in the ways I laid out before, but now she's even more wonderful because of the groom in these ways."  - "I'm so glad you found each other." END
BEGIN HERE Stories, of course, will make each of these bullet points better, and ensure that you give a well-balanced (you want some laughs, followed by some tears of joy!) toast that the bride, groom, and guests will remember for years to come. END
BEGIN HERE Sometimes as a guest, it's hard to shop the registry. As much as you love your friend's taste, buying her that towel set just doesn't seem personal enough. Or worse yet, it's wedding time and there's nothing left on her registry to buy. If writing a check isn't your thing — or you need an engagement or shower gift — there are a few times where it's okay to shop off the registry, and proper ways to do so. END
BEGIN HERE   It's okay to admit that your wallet can't afford their registry. It happens! That doesn't mean you get a pass and can show up to the shower or wedding empty handed. It's perfectly acceptable to look outside the registry when it doesn't fit your budget — again, keep their taste in mind. Find single item gifts that will have a long-lasting impact on the couple, like an engraved cutting board or picture frame with their wedding date on it. You can also DIY a gift — like a shadow box that contains their wedding invitation, flowers, and other special mementos — but only if DIY is really your forte. END

BEGIN HERE Destination weddings might be the best kind (who doesn't want to spend a few days on the beach or in a far-off city celebrating people they love?), but they also can be the most expensive. Flights and hotel rooms can rack up quickly, especially if the wedding is in a remote location or at a luxury property. So if you're already shelling out just to be there, do you also need to spend money on a wedding gift? Here's what our experts have to say. END
BEGIN HERE While your inclination might be to skip the gift, given how much you're spending to attend the wedding, tradition states that any wedding invitation comes with the obligation of sending a gift to the couple. If the wedding is particularly expensive, you can opt to send a lower-cost gift as a token of your good wishes, instead of the usual amount you might spend for a non-destination wedding. END
BEGIN HERE Some couples having destination weddings that cause guests to incur higher costs may request that guests not buy a gift at all. This does give you an out, so in this case it would be up to you whether or not to still get a gift. You may still want to send a little something as a gesture, whether it's a pretty frame or a bottle of wine or just a card with a nice note. END
BEGIN HERE Timing is also key. Don't plan to bring the gift with you. Instead, purchase and send it in advance of the wedding so that it arrives before you've departed, or just after the couple returns home, just as you would with a regular wedding gift. Even if you plan on giving cash or a check, make arrangements to send it in the mail instead of taking on your trip. You don't want to be responsible for extra money lying around your hotel room, and neither do the bride and groom! END

BEGIN HERE Bali offers something for every type of couple, and honeymoons there can be completely customized to your taste. For newlyweds who appreciate a lively scene, great food, lots of shopping and a dose of nightlife alongside their pool or beachside relaxation, Seminyak is a good choice. Book a private villa and make sure to visit Potato Head Beach Club by day, and La Favela for drinks by night. Echo Beach, just a bit north, is like a smaller-scale Seminyak, with waves worthy of beginner or expert surfers, lively restaurants (like Deus ex Machina and Old Man's) and well curated boutiques.

BEGIN HERE      Photo: Getty Images    END
BEGIN HERE Couples with an interest in spirituality, yoga, alternative medicine and Balinese culture should not miss Ubud, the heart of the island when it comes to rich traditions of dance, music and crafts. It's home to awe-inspiring rice terraces in the most brilliant green you can imagine, and surrounded by villages that each specialize in a different art — think villages for silver, wood carving, weaving, batik. There, the most beautiful hotel is the Four Seasons Bali at Sayan, which is as lush as it is luxurious. Try the imaginative tasting menu at Locavore, have some casual barbecue and martinis (approved by Anthony Bourdain) at Naughty Nuri's, try a vinyasa or meditation class at Yoga Barn and visit the Monkey Forest, if you don't mind the cute rascals potentially jumping on you. END
BEGIN HERE Mount Batur Bali Honeymoon END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Getty Images    END
BEGIN HERE Those who seek a bit more adventure on their honeymoon can arrange to do some hiking in the dark. The climb to Mount Batur, near Ubud, starts around 2 a.m. and can be fairly intense, but the prize is reaching the summit while the glowing red sun rises over another volcano and lake in the distance. If you have a penchant for underwater activities, Amed and the east coast of Bali are ideal, since the area is known for having the best scuba diving and snorkeling spots in addition to black-sand beaches. From there it's an easy fast boat ride to the Gili Islands — Meno is the most mellow, Trawangan is a party place, and Air is in between — which also boast prime diving, snorkeling, and likely the most clear turquoise water you've ever experienced. END

BEGIN HERE      Photo: Getty Images    END
BEGIN HERE The Bukit peninsula, at the very bottom of Bali, is known as a surfer's paradise, with dozens of breaks, many of them fairly serious. It's also home to a town called Nusa Dua, which is full of top resorts, such as The Mulia, high-end spas and white-sand beaches. On the western side of the peninsula you'll find Uluwatu, the most famous Bali surf spot. Uluwatu Surf Villas is a romantic place to spend your nights. Plan to rent scooters to get around (don't worry, there is not much in the way of traffic here). For a fancy fish dinner, head to nearby Jimbaran for a night, or climb down the stone steps to Bingin Beach for the line of casual restaurants where you can watch the sun set and eat freshly caught and grilled seafood with your feet in the sand.

BEGIN HERE      Photo: Kathryn Romeyn    END
BEGIN HERE The beaches in the Bukit are the very best in Bali, with the most beautifully colored Indian Ocean waters that range from jade green all the way to deep blue. They all require you to descend steps, which can be brutal on the way up, but again, worth it. Don't miss Thomas Beach, Balangan and Uluwatu, which you enter through a cave. If you're a glutton for punishment, head to Nyang Nyang — you could be the only people on the long, stunning beach thanks to its 300-plus steps. Get a rubdown at Tara Massage, which is not fancy but offers $6 one-hour massages that rival any five-star spa's, dine at Bukit Cafe, buy bikinis at I Love Bali and visit Single Fin for pitaya bowls, a sunset beer and bite and, each Sunday night, the biggest party on the whole island.

BEGIN HERE Forget a wedding weekend. When you're one of Brazil's top fashion bloggers, you have a wedding month! (Anything to wear another couture wedding dress, right?) Model and street style star Helena Bordon just celebrated her second wedding day, tying the knot again with Humberto Meirelles — this time in a sandy and sunny destination bash in St. Barths. END
BEGIN HERE Earlier this month, Bordon walked down the aisle in São Paulo, Brazil's St. Joseph Church to wed her financier beau, according to The Daily Mail. For wedding day 1, the blonde beauty pulled out a blast from the past, donning her mother's Valentino wedding gown for her own big day. And no need to worry if the recycled frock was still in style. Bordon's mother is none other than Donata Meirelles, style director of Vogue Brazil, after all. Like mother like fashionable daughter, right? Bordon paired the beaded sheath with a dramatic lace cathedral veil and after the "I do's," the glowing newlyweds headed to the bride's parents' home for an intimate reception lunch with 100 of their guests. The guest list of their second round of vows was a little more lengthy, as Brazil's fashion royalty descended upon the island of St. Barths for a destination "I do" party two weeks later. END
BEGIN HERE For the past few days, Bordon, her new hubby, and their party crew have been living it up in the St. Barth's sun and (thankfully!) posting all the details on Instagram. Bordon was seen frolicking in the sand wearing a crop top that proudly stated her "Bride" status, before walking down the aisle for the second time with her sweetheart. END
BEGIN HERE The street style star slipped on a slinky wedding dress by designer Francisco Costa, perfect for the seaside locale. The perfect pair tied the knot (again) under a canopy decked out in gauzy white fabric, creamy blooms, and lush greenery. After the couple had their "I do" re-do, Bordon and her hubby dined seaside, with tables adorned with purple orchids, under palm trees and romantic string lights. END

BEGIN HERE We've fan-girled over the ring, we've predicted the bride's future wedding dress, and we've discussed every rumored big day detail. All that's left is for Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth to admit it — they're engaged and planning the wedding of our, ahem, their dreams. Previously, Hemsworth denied the fact that he's back together with his former fiancé — despite that stunning sparkler that has taking up residence on Cyrus' left ring finger. But now, the Hunger Games hunk is singing a different tune — one that distinctly sounds like a confirmation of those engagement rumors. END
BEGIN HERE Since early this year, Cyrus has been spotted wearing her original diamond dazzler from Hemsworth, leading everyone to believe that the pair was back together and heading down the aisle. And we've been following the not-engaged-yet-totally-engaged duo ever since, from the pop star's reported move into Hemsworth's mansion, to their lunch with Cyrus' to-be in-laws in Australia where they supposedly began scouting out wedding venues. In mid-April, Hemsworth denied his engagement to Cyrus to Australia's TV Week magazine, but the man is totally a groom-to-be. How do we know? Well, the actor just let a lot slip in a recent interview with GQ Australia... END
BEGIN HERE When asked about his relationship with Cyrus, Hemsworth pretty much insinuated that the rumors were true, stating, "People will figure it out, they already have... They're not dumb." Umm, we're taking that to mean that the wedding invites are already in the mail, right Hemsworth? END
BEGIN HERE "I guess when I feel something, then I just feel it and I go for it," the actor continued. "I make my decisions about what's going to make me happy, what I think is right and what I want to do — and I don't worry too much outside of that." If that means a wedding is on the way, sounds like a solid plan to us! END
BEGIN HERE But what about the to-be-wed duo's initial split back in 2013? "Of course it was hard," said Hemsworth. "But at the time we were going in different directions and it's just what needed to happen. We were both super young and it was a good decision at the time — we both needed that." Sounds like absence indeed makes the heart grow fonder — and possibly results in some pretty impressive engagement bling! END
BEGIN HERE And now please excuse us; Now that we've got some engagement confirmation, it's time for us to head back to Pinterest to complete our dream board for their wedding extravaganza... END

BEGIN HERE Is there anything cuter than including babies in weddings? Whether you're using the terms "flower girl" and "ring bearer" pretty loosely (it's hard for them to carry rings and toss petals when they can't walk!) or are having your sister-in-law carry her new son down the aisle, there's nothing quite so aww-inducing! And that's before you get around to picking out the tiniest formalwear you've ever seen — itty bitty tuxedos and clouds of tulle are sure to put a smile on your face!

BEGIN HERE Let's set the record straight: There's no be-all, end-all guide that can definitively say what all human beings enjoy between the sheets. (Different strokes for different folks, right?) But there are simply some moves that most people don't actually enjoy — despite what various media might want us to believe. END
BEGIN HERE "Whether they primarily come from slumber parties and the locker room, men's magazines and porno, or women's magazines and bachelorette parties, the helpful hints we get may be seriously flawed," says Carol Queen, Ph.D., sexologist and author of The Sex & Pleasure Book: Good Vibrations Guide to Great Sex for Everyone. "More commonly, they are perfectly fine moves for someone — but if they don't work for you and your partner, it doesn't really matter who else likes them, right?" END
BEGIN HERE Here are 10 moves that might not be working for your partner. How to know? Read them over, then ask your partner if they're working for you both. END
BEGIN HERE   This move, says Queen, "is loved by some and not at all appreciated by others. We can thank porn for making this activity look like a regular part of intercourse. Again, some will like this, while others will equate it with assault!" END
BEGIN HERE Wedding season is officially in full swing! With the gorgeous weather and seemingly endless hours of daylight, it's no surprise that the summer months are some of the most popular times of the year to say, "I do." But when the heat is on, hearts will melt, and unfortunately, so will other things. To be the absolute best summer wedding host you can be, we talked to a slew of expert wedding planners, who gave us the scoop on what they wish more summer brides would do. Get your notepads and pens out, ladies! END
BEGIN HERE   "Buttercream is by far the best frosting option when it comes to standing up to the summertime heat, but even this yummy option can only endure so much. To prevent a full on wedding cake meltdown, ask your site's staff to store the cake in the refrigerator until you're ready to cut it. This will also keep mosquitos and gnats from attacking it. I've seen way too many cake photos ruined by these little critters!" — Andrea Freeman, celebrity wedding planner at Andrea Freeman Events  END
BEGIN HERE Anyone who has started the wedding planning process knows that things don't always go according to plan, no matter how organized you try to be. While brides can usually roll with the punches and find back-up options if the details won't be revealed until guests arrive, it can be frustrating when changes are made to things that you've already told them about. One such thing? The rehearsal dinner venue! So what should you do if you've planned the rehearsal dinner and sent out invitations, but have to find a new venue at the last minute? Our experts weigh in. END
BEGIN HERE If the change of venue is no fault of your own (for example, because the venue double-booked you, not because your guest list exceeds their capacity), begin by talking to the venue manager about whether there are any services they can offer. If it's a restaurant or brewery, can they offer discounted catering or beer for you to serve in your new space? Or would they be willing to cover the cost of sending out a new invitation? Don't be too pushy, but if the cost is reasonable, see if they'll chip in to cover it. After all, if the change is because of something the venue did, they should help you rectify the situation. END
BEGIN HERE Now comes sharing the information with your guests. Begin by updating your wedding website to reflect the new information as soon as possible. Add a note on the page to alert guests to the change so they'll take a second look, too! END
BEGIN HERE Since not everyone will use your wedding website as their main source of information, you'll also want to send out a follow-up outlining the new location and time. If you have enough advanced notice (and room in your budget), you could have small cards or postcards printed with the new information, then mail them to your guests. Pressed for time or short on cash? Gather guests' email addresses and send out e-vites instead. END
BEGIN HERE Encourage your parents and wedding party to spread the word, too — they could send texts to other friends on the guest list or make phone calls. END
BEGIN HERE If your rehearsal dinner is smaller, consider making personal calls yourselves, then following up with an email that contains the timing and address for easy reference. END

BEGIN HERE Sports buffs Kate Owens and Eric Martin first met during a soccer tournament in Arizona in 2011 — Kate's Virginia Tech club team was staying at the same hotel as the players from the Naval Academy, which just so happened to include Eric. While their shared affinity for the sport was strong, it soon paled in comparison to their love for one another. Just two years after the duo first bonded over soccer (and just weeks before he deployed with the Marine Corps for the very first time), Eric popped the question on his bride-to-be's birthday in December of 2013. END
BEGIN HERE As any military couple will tell you, planning a wedding during deployment is no easy task and Eric's career as a first lieutenant in the Marine Corps meant that he was in training with little-to-no phone access in the month before the couple's nuptials. Although that left much of the burden on Kate, the two found creative ways to make it work, and even carved out a little time the night before the wedding to finish their last remaining tasks. "We chose our first dance song out at a bar after the rehearsal dinner," Kate laughs. END
BEGIN HERE But the distance couldn't stop this couple from planning a beautiful June 6, 2015, celebration at the Bakery 105 in Wilmington, North Carolina. On the big day, the venue's architecture took center stage, complemented by Kate and Eric's neutral color palette of ivory, champagne, peach, and pops of pink and stunning floral arrangements from Beautiful Flowers By June.

BEGIN HERE Although Kate admits she's hardly a big shopper, she wouldn't settle for any old wedding dress. In fact, the bride and her mother drove an hour from home in search of bridal salons with styles she might like. "The tiny shop we ended up getting my wedding dress from was two minutes from my parents' house," Kate laughs. "This was the last place I expected to buy it." END
BEGIN HERE The wedding dress Kate chose featured organza and lace and a plunging back line but most importantly, it met her number one criteria: It had straps. "I wanted a dress with straps or sleeves, but most looked matronly on me since I am five-foot-three," she says. "This one was modern and I had never seen it before. It fit my body perfectly." And Eric, of course, donned his Marine Corps dress blues. END

BEGIN HERE There are literally thousands of beautiful venues with large exterior event areas all over the world. Some have an outside space for cocktails, with dinner and dancing inside later on. But many, historic buildings for example, don't have any entertainment space inside the buildings, so your guests won't get any relief from the summertime temps, even if it's a particularly hot day.

I learned the hard way that kissing swans appear to be weeping once the great melt begins. Melting dolphins are flat-out obscene (if you know what I mean). Ice sculptures that incorporate words are often illegible before cocktails are over when they're displayed in heat and humidity. Bottom line?

BEGIN HERE Whether your parents are still best friends or are barely civil to one another, you'll want to arrange for pictures with your individual families first and foremost, so put those at the top of the list. The two of you as a couple should take pictures with each parent, including their new significant other if they are in a relationship or are remarried. Inviting step-siblings to the wedding? Include them here, too. END
BEGIN HERE If your parents are more friendly with one another, model your family pictures after shots including the bride and groom's parents: Have Mom and her new spouse on one side of the two of you, with Dad and his new spouse on the other side. You and your hubby might want to swap places halfway through so everyone has pictures standing next to their newly-married kid! END
BEGIN HERE Planning on doing photos with your siblings included in the mix? If both of your parents will be in the picture and their step-kids will be, too, follow the above format, mixing your siblings in along with your Mom and Dad, then arranging step-siblings on the outer edges, on the same side as their respective parents. END
BEGIN HERE If you want a big group photo with your family, his family, and all of your parents and siblings, you might need to do so on a set of steps if your growing family is big enough. Put siblings and biological parents in the front (along with their spouses), then arrange step-siblings just behind and above them. END
BEGIN HERE For situations that are a little less friendly, you may want to skip the combined family pictures and instead focus solely on taking photos with each individual family, then combinations of sets of parents (the two of you with your mom and her husband with your groom's parents, then with your dad and his wife with your groom's parents, etc.). END

BEGIN HERE Her big sis may be the one with the royal title, but when it comes to bridesmaid style, Pippa Middleton is the one who takes the crown. It's been five years since Pippa popped out of that limo outside of Westminster Abbey and shot to international fame. Sure, she wasn't the star of the show and spent the day holding and fluffing the bride-to-be's long luxe train, but didn't Middleton look just fabulous while doing so? Her Alexander McQueen white sheath (and royal good looks!) might have to do something with that. But if you've been lusting after that famous frock — good news! It's now 40 percent off! (And of course still super expensive...) END
BEGIN HERE Middleton's bridesmaid dress is now almost as famous as her older sister's, The Duchess of Cambridge, extravagant lace wedding dress. The clean and crisp frock featured a relaxed, curve-hugging silhouette, a chic row of buttons down its back, dainty floral detailing around the sleeves, and a memorable cowl neckline — all in a creamy white hue. In fact, the frock started a trend, with tons of brides opting to dress their 'maids in the snow white hue normally reserved for their own dresses. "It was completely unexpected," Middleton previously told Today of the world's reaction to the luxe look. "You know, I think the plan was not really for it to be a significant dress. Really just to sort of blend in with the train. I suppose [the reaction was] flattering... It's actually still in my wardrobe at home." Well now you can swipe that iconic dress right out of Middleton's closet — well, a lookalike piece, at least. END

BEGIN HERE Although Middleton's bridesmaid dress was a custom creation (the lucky girl...), Alexander McQueen offers an almost-identical gown that has been marked down by 40 percent on the fashion retailer site Forward by Elyse Walker, according to Us Weekly, meaning this stunning sheath is now a total steal! END

BEGIN HERE Perhaps you're better off setting a more realistic budget for your bridesmaids' wonderful white dresses. Your girls will probably thank you. (Unless of course you're marrying a real-life Prince Charming — then by all means, shop on!) END
BEGIN HERE  21 of the Royal Couple's Cutest Moments END
BEGIN HERE In July of 2014, two years after they started dating and four years after becoming friends at pharmacy school at the University of Colorado, Denver, Anna and Derek headed from the mountains to Pennsylvania to visit Anna's family for the 4th of July. The ring had been burning a hole in Derek's pocket for months, but he was waiting for the perfect opportunity to pop the question — and for an opportunity to include Anna's parents. "I was so worried someone would search my bag while we were going through security at the airport!" Derek remembers. He'd planned to propose on her parents' lakeside dock, but a thunderstorm rolled in and changed the plans. So with Anna's mom armed with a camera and her dad helping to guide the unknowing bride-to-be to a more picturesque spot in front of the windows, Derek got down on one knee. END
BEGIN HERE So how did a mountain couple with East Coast roots end up on a vineyard in California? "We love to travel and we knew we wanted a destination wedding," says Anna. "We chose B.R. Cohn for their stunning property, enough space to have both our ceremony and reception on-site, and the perfect spot in the middle of the vineyard, beneath an ancient oak tree, for the ceremony." They let the beauty of the property speak for itself, opting for a rustic and natural theme with a relaxed vibe on September 18, 2015. Check out the beautiful details, photographed by Christine Chang Photography, below! END

Wellesley is a descendant of Queen Victoria (by way of her mother) and the daughter of the 9th Duke of Wellington (her father's ancestor defeated Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815), according to US Weekly. Her husband is a Columbian-American financier, Harvard graduate, and philanthropist in his home country of Colombia. END

BEGIN HERE To a newly-engaged bride, practical and time-consuming tasks like learning how to purchase engagement ring insurance — and then getting around to actually doing it — can seem a lot less thrilling than, say, finding your perfect wedding dress. However, if your engagement ring falls down the garbage disposal, flies off on a rollercoaster, or sheds a diamond or two, you'll wish you had better protected your sentimental stone. We've asked jewelry and insurance experts to weigh in on what it takes to make sure you'll be able to enjoy your ring for years to come — no matter what life throws at your left hand. Read their advice, below. END
BEGIN HERE   The good news is your engagement ring was a smart investment! As its value has likely gone up since it was purchased, it's important to have your ring reappraised every 2 to 3 years for insurance purposes. And consider going back to the same appraiser each time (assuming you had a good experience), says Bulsara. Most reputable appraisers will retain a copy of your original appraisal and can work from that instead of starting from scratch — and that cuts costs. (But bring a copy of your appraisal in the event they don't keep records for that long.) END

Liz Feldman, writer/producer on CBS's 2 Broke Girls, along with four other real brides share what tripped them up in their wedding planning and how they solved it.  END
BEGIN HERE When I was asked to write some introductory lines for Brides's same-sex wedding-planning guide, I got a little choked up. Just a few years ago, it was illegal for me to get married. The government had given us civil unions and domestic partnerships, but it wasn't the same. We weren't equal. END
BEGIN HERE I met musician Rachael Cantu in 2008, and within a year, I was 6,000 percent sure I wanted to spend my life with her. With Rachael I'd found true comfort and absolute joy. We wanted to give a solid foundation to our future children, but we were forbidden to marry by DOMA (Defense of Marriage Act, signed into law by President Clinton in 1996) and California's Proposition 8 (stating that marriage was between a man and a woman). All I wanted was to wear a cute white suit, stand up in front of my friends and family, and promise to love this woman forever. So in 2012, I flipped Prop 8 the finger and proposed to Rachael. She said, "Wait! Is this really happening!?" followed by a "Yes, of course!" A few months later, she proposed back with a song she wrote. END
BEGIN HERE In May 2013, I walked down the aisle to that song at our backyard wedding. It was the best day of my life; it just wasn't legal. END

BEGIN HERE To cover our bases, we flew to New York, which had legalized same-sex marriage, and had another wedding in Brooklyn. But even that wasn't federally recognized. We'd gotten married twice and were still being denied the legal bounty that straight married couples enjoy, like Social Security benefits and hospital visitation rights. Then, in 2013, the Supreme Court overturned Prop 8 and DOMA. And last year, when the Court made marriage equality the law of the land, I and so many others experienced the moment we'd fought for, cried over, and dreamt of. So it's now my pleasure and honor to write this, as I am finally, happily, legally married in all 50 states. END

BEGIN HERE You and your fiancé may have talked about the big things — think: how you'll handle your finances and whether you want children — but we're willing to bet you two have yet to have a few conversations simply because you didn't realize they were important. But we've got you covered. Here, according to relationship and etiquette expert April Masini, are four talks you never thought of but must have before you tie the knot. END
BEGIN HERE . END
BEGIN HERE   You could take your spouse by unpleasant surprise if he or she doesn't know that your long-term goals conflict with his or hers. "If you get married and then divulge that you don't want to live in a city any more, you're springing a big one on your spouse" says Masini. "If you want to quit your longtime job and go to med school at age 40, be (way) upfront about this. Your spouse doesn't want to quash your dreams — but he may not want to share them, either." END
BEGIN HERE This one is for the grooms-to-be. When it comes to the most important question of your lives, popping the question in a place that is as perfect as the ring you're about to give her is crucial — after all, the story is just as important as the proposal itself. From sky-high seats above Lincoln Road to intimate Italian eateries downtown, these five Miami restaurants are sure to provide just the right ambiance for the big moment. END

BEGIN HERE Braids are back (or still here?) this year and in a big way too. "Designers like Alberta Ferreti, Giles, Temperley, and Chanel incorporated soft feminine updos that infused romantic, flirtatious and ethereal feels to their collections," says Grand. Hair is kept loose with "undone" braids, twists, light volume and soft texture, ensuring things aren't "too polished" yet still look completely put together. The good news is, this style can be made to fit any type of wedding (and bride for that matter), be it a casual outdoor event or a more formal ballroom black tie affair. END

Then I took her up to this place up in Hollywood Hills that has basically a panoramic 360 view of all of Hollywood and all of the valley. So we saw all the lights, the Hollywood sign, the Griffith Park Observatory, and it was so romantic. We were up there until 3 in the morning, just talking and looking at the lights.

BEGIN HERE "When I first met my future in-laws, I was well aware that I wasn't what they had in mind for a daughter-in-law. My fiancé is the eldest in a traditional Gujarati family from Mumbai and, like everyone else in this large joint family, was meant to be in an arranged marriage. I'm a half-Cherokee, half-white woman from the US. His mother doesn't speak any English, and my Hindi was basic at best. His father clearly wasn't happy with the situation. The first meeting was at a teahouse in the lobby of the hotel I was staying at in Mumbai. My fiancé's family didn't know about me, let alone that I was in India. He sprung it on them on his dad's 60th birthday. The first meeting was awkward and nerve-wracking. During the next meeting, I 'interviewed' with his grandfather who seemed confused as to why I couldn't 'find a man from America.' However, I'm blessed to have been welcomed into this super-sized family and, two years later, we're all learning the new dynamics together." —Jessica END
BEGIN HERE "I nearly killed my mother-in-law! My husband, an only child, was very nervous to have the two ladies in his life meet. His mother, a full foot taller than I, is gregarious and very sensitive. After meeting her, I thought I'd be the best future daughter-in-law and send her a huge bouquet of flowers, letting her know I look forward to sharing her son. This gesture sent her into a full-blown asthma attack. She thought it was sweet but she put the flowers in the fridge to keep from repeating this misstep throughout the day. She cried at our wedding and was devastated that I was "stealing" her kid. But in the nearly 23 years since, we have become very close and have a lot of fun." —Jess END
BEGIN HERE "When my fiancé brought me to his parents' house to meet them, the unthinkable happened: I got food poisoning from my mother-in-law-to-be's shrimp scampi! We wound up in the ER, as I was a mess from both ends! She felt awful to have made me sick, and I felt terribly guilty to have unintentionally offended her! It took a while for her to feel comfortable cooking for me, and truth be told, for me to feel comfortable eating her food, but six years later all is good!" —Beth END
BEGIN HERE "The first time I met Dan's mother I blurted out, 'Uck, where did you get that painting?' in a voice that clearly showed I thought the water color was repugnant. Naturally it turned out she painted it! It was quite the horrible gaffe, but I said over and over that my tone came out wrong, and I really, really loved it. She wound up believing me and — sigh — that awful painting now hangs in a place of honor in my home!" —Sara END
BEGIN HERE "The first time I met future in-laws for dinner, my husband's stepsister was there. She was a bartender at a bar I used to frequent, but I didn't know she had any connection to my husband at all. When I walked in, she announced, 'I know her, she is ALWAYS at the bar!' The rest of the evening she regaled everyone with these crazy stories about things I had done while drunk at her bar. It was not great. There should be some sort of bartender/drinker confidentiality agreement, like lawyers and medical professionals have — I got the last laugh because now his parents love me and don't speak to her!" —Ellen END
BEGIN HERE "I met my future in-laws in the middle of the last presidential election. I was and am an ardent Obama supporter, and they wanted Romney. If only I'd obeyed the common sense rule of not having a political debate, but alas, things got heated — but definitely not friendly. We've kept quiet during this 2016 Presidential election!" —Pam END

Johnson is prepping to say "I do" to her longtime love, NFL player Andrew East, in a Nashville, Tennessee wedding that is sure to be stunning. END
BEGIN HERE "We're going to start distancing ourselves from one another before the wedding but we want to go on one last date night as boyfriend and girlfriend to build the excitement for this weekend," Johnson told People. We're totally stealing this idea of one last date night before you're husband and wife — we hope the Dancing With the Stars champ doesn't mind! END
BEGIN HERE The pro athlete is even sharing her almost-a-Mrs. journey with her Instagram followers, posting a cute photo Friday of her and what we can only assume is her bridal party prepping for the big day with a ceremony rehearsal. "It's rehearsal day!!! Here we go ladies!!! #broandbug #weddingweekend," she captioned the cute group photo (below). END
BEGIN HERE The bride-to-be also posted a cute snap of her picking up her (again, totally assuming!) wedding dress. "Guess what I just picked up," she captioned the photo of her holding up an enormous white garment bag — you know, the kind they put wedding dresses in! END
BEGIN HERE As an Olympic gymnast, Johnson has preformed under tons of high-pressure circumstances and in front of millions of people so she's probably totally calm about walking down the aisle, right? According to the athlete, she's anything but. "This is strange but I'm a very shy person in front of crowds, so the whole idea of everybody being there for just Andrew and me, and everybody staring at us makes me really nervous," She said. "And I'm not a really girly-girl and I'll have on this beautiful dress and it's out of my comfort zone." END
BEGIN HERE On top of being nervous about having all eyes on her, she's got a million and one other little details to smooth out too before she can really enjoy being a bride. "I'm feeling a little overwhelmed because you never realize how many small details crop up so close to the wedding," she said. "Seating arrangements, trying to find ceremony music, picking up favor bags, writing cards." END
BEGIN HERE Although she has a little to-do list and some pre-wedding jitters the Dancing With the Stars champion's nerves are strictly planning related. When it comes to East, she knows he's the one. "Everything is right about him!" she told the magazine. "The more I wasn't trying to impress him by being that celebrity girl or Olympic gymnast, but was just my weird, awkward self, the more he loved me. And it just became more and more comfortable." END
BEGIN HERE There are a whole lot of things about Mariah Carey that many other soon-to-be brides will never be able to relate to. Her 35-carat engagement ring, for starters. And then there's the sure-to-be astronomical price tag of her upcoming nuptials where she'll reportedly be shuttling out her wedding guests on her fiancé, James Packer's, fleet of private planes to their tropical destination "I do's." Something tells us not all brides have the "On which private island should we tie the knot?" wedding planning dilemma... But there is an aspect of Mariah Carey's wedding prep plans where most engaged ladies can relate — her desire for the ultimate bridal body. And what's most surprising is that her slim-down plan is actually pretty sane! (Not like that engagement ring...) END
BEGIN HERE Although no one should ever feel pressured to lose weight for that walk down the aisle, a whole slew of brides want to spend their time as a bride-to-be getting healthy — whether it's to feel confident in their sexy sheath wedding dress or to just start off married life on the right foot. And it turns out the superstar songstress is no different. But while you'd might expect Carey's wedding-day diet plan to include expert celebrity trainers, three carrots, and a leaf of lettuce, it actually sounds way healthier — and way more doable! — than what you'd might think. END
BEGIN HERE According to a source close to the singer, Carey's bridal body plan centers around a protein-based diet that starts off with a morning smoothie or protein shake, followed by five small meals consumed throughout the day. "Mariah is only eating four ounces of grilled chicken, lean beef, or one of her favorites — broiled Chilean Sea Bass or grilled shrimp with grilled asparagus," the source explained to The Daily Mail. END
BEGIN HERE But a deprivation diet this is definitely not! "She is also eating some of her favorites," the source continued, "like baked salmon, chicken salad with light mayo or mustard, and sushi. Mariah also loves cheese, so sometimes she will have some Brie on low fat crackers as a snack." Sushi, cheese, and mayo?! Now this is a wedding diet we can definitely get behind! END
BEGIN HERE  4 Reasons You Shouldn't Crash Diet Before Your Wedding END
BEGIN HERE But of course, any bride could tell you that pre-"I do" diets aren't all fun and games. Since Carey is currently touring in Europe — the pasta capital of the world! — it's sometimes hard to stay on course. But she's got quite the goal in mind. "She wants to have an hourglass figure so she can have a very tight, sexy, figure-hugging gown," the source said. "Mariah says she has to be very disciplined because she wants to take James' breath away when he sees her for the first time in her wedding gown." END

BEGIN HERE Even our best friends can make bad bridesmaids. Here are five kinds of difficult bridesmaids you may find in your own wedding party, complete with expert advice on how to deal with each one. END
BEGIN HERE   Whether she's your partner's mean sibling or another family member you had to welcome into the fold, this is one bridesmaid you didn't necessarily want with you. "But while she may not be part of your squad, but think about the long road ahead," says Canada, who encourages you to welcome her into the fold and make a better future for you both. Adds Fisher, "she might be feeling the same uncomfortable feelings you do about it, so if you had to ask your future sister-in-law, use this as an opportunity to get to know her better. She is going to be your family, so embrace the situation and be positive." END
BEGIN HERE Flower girls bring an undeniable cuteness to a wedding ceremony. Even if they don't make it all the way down the aisle, that collective "Aww!" is reason enough to send a few adorable little ones down the aisle in front of you. What makes them even more adorable are those pint-sized dresses, from flowing tutus to full-on ball gowns, complete with tiaras and shimmering Mary Janes. But even though they're small, those tiny frocks can be expensive! The question is, who is supposed to pay for them? Our experts weigh in. END
BEGIN HERE Just like you're not required (or expected) to pay for your bridesmaids' or groomsmen's attire, you aren't obligated to buy your flower girl's dress, either. It's an expense that falls to the child's parents, so they should consider that cost when deciding if their child will be in your wedding. (Side note: make sure you talk to the parents about all the details before you ask their children to be in your wedding, to make sure no little hearts are broken if the parents don't approve.) END
BEGIN HERE However, purchasing the dress or an accompanying accessory is a great gift to offer, especially if you've got a particular look or outfit in mind. If you know you just want the girls in all white with lace accents, but don't mind if they're mismatched beyond that (or have found an affordable dress that comes in a range of sizes to fit girls of varying ages), it's fine to pass the cost on to the parents. But if that dress is made from the same lace as your gown and is custom-ordered (a.k.a. expensive!), you should check with the parents before you place the order, and offer to cover part of the costs. END
BEGIN HERE  Is It Weird to Not Have a Ring Bearer? END
BEGIN HERE An adorable and affordable option is to have each girl's parents buy the girl a dress in a solid color like white, ivory, blush, or navy, and then to gift the girls with cardigans to keep them warm and cover their shoulders, which will help create a more cohesive look while allowing each set of parents to spend what they're comfortable with.

BEGIN HERE It makes sense, then that in my counseling practice, I see a lot of short-engagement brides. Because when you're changing part of your identity from single to married, a lot of strong feelings of glee and joy as well as sadness, fear, anxiety, and even grief arise. It's all perfectly normal for brides-to-be to experience a broad spectrum of intense emotion. It's how you make these major evolutions in your identity that are happening to you right now. END
BEGIN HERE Oh yes, you're also planning your wedding... END
BEGIN HERE Is this a lot of emotion to process in a brief period? Yes. Is it doable? Absolutely. What you need to focus on is self-care. We know what you're thinking: "There no time!" But you must make it — to eat well and exercise, to take breaks from wedding planning, to discern what needs to be perfect and when are things "good enough." END
BEGIN HERE What's really going to get you through is staying connected to family and friends. Share with them all that you are processing, thinking, feeling, and going through — the real stuff, not just the wedding planning. Your nearest and dearest can pitch in with the wedding work, yes, but what you really need them there for is to listen, to understand, to help you work through all your very normal emotions that you're having to process at semi-warp speed.

BEGIN HERE When Mike Evans, wide receiver for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, was ready to propose to Ashli Dotson, he knew he wanted to pop the question with their families around them. So he took advantage of a well-timed family gathering at his home in Tampa, Florida. On December 19, 2014, two days after Ashli's birthday and just before Christmas, everyone got together to open holiday gifts since both families wouldn't be spending the actual day together. "I was opening a gift from Mike, a pair of black high heels, and inside this wrapped shoe box was a smaller ring box," Ashli remembers. Then, the football pro dropped to one knee and asked his love to be with him forever. END
BEGIN HERE The future Mr. and Mrs. Evans decided on a wedding at the Corinthian in Houston, Texas, a location that was both central to their two families and could accommodate their 500 person guest list. "We loved that it was an old bank renovated into an event hall," the bride says. "The Corinthian is gorgeous with huge pillars, high ceilings, and marble floors." With the locale locked in, the pair tapped Todd Events to help bring their vision of a timeless Texas wedding to life.

"We envisioned something elegant but laid-back and definitely not stuffy," the bride says. "We wanted everyone to enjoy themselves and let their hair down. We are both 22 and many of our guests were around our age." So in addition to a photo save-the-date with sleek gold typography, the bride and groom chose a classic wedding invite with a fun metallic envelope. END

BEGIN HERE It didn't take Ashli long to find her Alon Livné wedding dress — in fact, it was the very first gown she tried on! Despite how much she loved the stunning figure-hugging lace silhouette, Ashli tried a few more styles before going with her gut. "That day everyone kept asking me, 'What would you change about this dress?' and the Alon Livne was the only one that I loved exactly the way it was," the bride says. "The other I tried on always had at least one thing I didn't like." END
BEGIN HERE She accessorized with a pair of Jimmy Choo shoes, a long veil, and the traditional something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue, but tactfully chose a meaningful item that covered the bulk of the list. Diamond earrings and a diamond drop necklace gifted to her by Mike on the wedding day served as her something new while Ashli's grandmother's priceless heirloom white gold ring with a diamond and blue sapphire was tied to her bouquet of garden roses, ranunculus, hydrangeas, and lilies as her something old, borrowed, and blue.

Black ties, classic cufflinks, and patent leather shoes finished out their wedding day looks. END

Chiavari chairs were lined up across the length of the grand room and tall Lucite columns were placed at intervals and decorated with lush floral arrangements. Mixes of hydrangeas, roses, and greenery appeared as if floating throughout the ornate room. As a finishing touch, Venetian chandeliers were decorated with a ring of flowers and crystal strands and hung above the long aisle. END
BEGIN HERE Instead of creating an altar, the couple and their planners decided to use the raised staircase at the end of the room as a natural pedestal. There, bridesmaids and groomsmen could stand on the staircase behind the couple as they exchanged vows. END
BEGIN HERE Although Mike's young daughter was supposed to make her way down the aisle alone, there was an adorable last minute change to the processional. "Mackenzie got stage fright before walking down the aisle," Ashli remembers. "She froze in place when our guests gave a loud 'Awe.' Mike walked back down to go get her so that he could help her down the aisle." The doting dad then helped Mackenzie make her way to the front of the ceremony. END

BEGIN HERE Choosing a wedding date is a daunting task. There are so many schedules to consider, from both of your work schedules to when your parents are free to which weekend your younger brother will be taking the SATs. And while you want to avoid the busiest weekends of the year (we're looking at you, Labor Day weekend!), there's a reason summer is the most popular time of the year to get married: The weather is gorgeous, people are more available, and everyone loves an excuse for a mid-summer getaway! The downside to choosing a popular weekend? The chance that someone else you know and love is getting married that same weekend! So while you might hope that getting the word out early will help avoid another wedding in the family the same weekend as yours, what should you do if two of you have chosen the same wedding date? Here's what our experts have to say. END
BEGIN HERE The last thing you want to hear is that someone you care about won't be able to attend your wedding. Even worse? Finding out they can't attend because they'll be getting married the same day — meaning you'll have to miss their wedding, too! And while no one should expect either one of you to change all of your plans to accommodate the other person's celebration, there are a few other consequences of having a wedding the same weekend as a close friend or family member that you'll want to keep in mind. END
BEGIN HERE  How to Choose a Wedding Date that Works for Everyone END
BEGIN HERE The first is the guest list. If the other wedding is for an aunt, uncle, or cousin, some of your relatives may have to choose between your two weddings, which can be a tough spot to put people in. There's a good chance some of your family members (particularly the ones who are more closely related to one of you than the other) will choose the other wedding over yours. If you and your cousin are related by marriage, not by blood, this shouldn't be too complicated. Sure, your aunt's husband (who is your cousin's uncle) will probably go to your cousin's wedding instead of yours, and your aunt may decide to join him, but your blood relatives will probably choose your wedding (if they're invited to your cousin's at all). If your mom and your cousin's dad are siblings, things get a little trickier. The family will need to pick one event over the other, but try not to take it personally. Instead, consider planning a casual joint celebration after the fact so you both have a chance to spend some time with everyone — and each other! END
BEGIN HERE Is a friend getting married the same weekend as you? Your friend group should naturally divide itself, with mutual friends choosing the wedding of whomever they're closest to. Again, a post-wedding joint party is a great way to all celebrate together! END

From New York City high rises to the Caribbean's sandy shores, Trai Byers and Grace Gealey went from co-stars on the hit FOX show, Empire to husband and wife. On Thursday April 14, Byers and Gealey — known as Andre Lyon and Anika Calhoun to Empire fanatics — officially tied the knot! And if their on-screen wardrobes are any indication, this must have been one stylish wedding... END
BEGIN HERE After getting engaged back in July, Byers and Gealey have been keeping their wedding plans pretty much underwraps, which comes at no real surprise since they've always been rather tight-lipped when it comes to their romantic relationship. "I'm not a fan of flings when you work, cause that's where it gets a little dangerous," Gealey shared on FABLife, a few months ago when she first revealed her engagement to Byers. "I think that if you do get involved — I keep wanting to say on set — I think that if you do get involved at your workplace, you have to know that this is something that you want to be invested in, and this is just not just something that is frivolous and fleeting," Well, frivolous and fleeting this relationship is definitely not, with the exchange of their wedding bands earlier this week. END

BEGIN HERE The co-star couple headed to the Caribbean to tie the knot, exchanging their vows in a beachside ceremony, according to TMZ. And although, none of their Empire co-stars were in attendance (the newlyweds decided to keep the guest list to just their closest family and friends), the nuptials certainly weren't short on style or dance-worthy music. After saying their "I do's," the just-wedded pair and their wedding guests headed to a mansion on Grand Cayman Island to dine on steak and lobster and dance the night away to hip-hop, disco and, totally appropriate given their venue, reggae tunes. Cookie would definitely approve... END
BEGIN HERE No one wants to postpone his or her wedding. But whether you don't have the funds to make this commitment now, a family member has become gravely ill, or you're simply not sure you're ready to tie the knot, it's better to pump the brakes than press full-steam ahead toward an inevitable crash. That doesn't make it any easier, though. We gathered expert advice on how to postpone your wedding easily as possible. END
BEGIN HERE First, you must decide if you'll choose a new date or cancel your wedding entirely. Whatever you decide, loop in your family and wedding party as soon as possible to let them know the change in plans. If you've chosen a new date, make sure the new date also works for them, says Jaclyn Fisher, owner of Two Little Birds Planning in Philadelphia. END
BEGIN HERE "When breaking the news to family and the wedding party, just be honest," she recommends. "They love you and will be there to support you. Don't be afraid to ask for help or take people up on it when they offer to help. Just as with planning a wedding, there is a lot to do when rescheduling one." END
BEGIN HERE Next, you'll want to review the cancelation policies in your venue and vendor contracts. Most vendors will have a cancelation policy in place, Fisher says, which will contractually detail exactly what will happen next if you postpone or cancel. If you've chosen a new date, some vendors will happily shift the date on your contract without penalty. If they're not available on your new date, however, the contract you signed will dictate what happens next. END
BEGIN HERE  5 Things to Consider When Choosing Your Wedding Date END
BEGIN HERE If you're canceling rather than changing your wedding date, it's best to advise your vendors as soon as possible. "Many wedding contracts, especially for venues, state that the closer to the wedding date that a couple cancels, the more money you owe the vendor or venue," Fisher says. Canceling your wedding sooner rather than later could save you big bucks, "so as soon as you know you're postponing the wedding, let the your venue and vendors know," Fisher says. "It's a conversation that should happen over the phone, but be sure to follow up in writing so it's all documented." END
BEGIN HERE Couples who've sent out their save-the-dates or invitations will want to contact their guests next. "Notify them of the postponement and the new date, if there is one," says Fisher. "Couples can communicate this via printed cards, email, or phone calls, but a card is beneficial so you don't have to explain the situation over and over again." Don't delay on this important — but uncomfortable — step. "It's important to be proactive and honest to avoid confusion and speculation," Fisher says, "but at the same time, you don't have to share the intimate details if you don't feel comfortable — or if it's not appropriate." END
BEGIN HERE Then, cancel everything that remains: vendor meetings, dress fittings, the rehearsal dinner, and more. "Sit down and make a list of everything that needs to be addressed," Fisher advises. "Divide and conquer the list with the help of your partner, family, and wedding party." Finally, she adds, "couples shouldn't feel embarrassed about postponing their wedding. It happens more than you think." END
BEGIN HERE She's here! She's here! A legend has officially been born — Chrissy Teigen and John Legend just welcomed their baby girl into the world and we couldn't be happier for the brand new parents. And although a photo of their little one has yet to be released, we're betting that the musician and the supermodel chef definitely cooked up a cute one. END
BEGIN HERE We feel totally lucky to have watched Legend and Teigen's journey from newlyweds to new parents, first hand. From fawning over their beautiful wedding photos (remember Chrissy's swoon-worthy Vera Wang tulle ball gown?) to laughing over her too-real pregnancy tweets on everything from crazy cravings to her growing mom bod, to cooing over baby names, we got to see it all. It seems like only yesterday that Teigen revealed her fertility struggles to the world on her talk show FABLife. "John and I are having trouble," the model explained in the emotional moment. "We would have had kids five, six years ago if it'd happened. But my gosh, it's been a process!" Thankfully, their story has the happiest of endings, with the addition of Luna Simone Stephens into their little family. (FYI: John Legend is his stage name, the new dad's real name is John Roger Stephens.) END
BEGIN HERE Teigen and Legend revealed the oh-so-adorable name on social media this morning. "She's here! Luna Simone Stephens, we are so in love with you! And sleepy. Very sleepy," the new mom wrote on Instagram, posting a photo of her little one's weight — 6 pounds, 11 ounces. Legend also shared the too-exciting news on Twitter. "Our new love is here!" the singer said. "Luna Simone Stephens, born on Thursday, the 14th. We couldn't be happier!" END

From belly-hugging tight dresses to glitzy red carpet gowns, the supermodel (now super mom!) certainly knew how to dress up a baby bump. But give her a few years, and we're sure that her mini-me's style will end being just as jealous-worthy. (She does have quite the role model, after all...) END
BEGIN HERE While we've been loving the single-tiered sweets and alternative confections (wedding pies, ice cream, donuts — oh my!) being served at modern matrimonies, one thing's for sure: Our wedding cake sweet tooth will never be satisfied! And that's why we're officially obsessed with showstopping sweets, over-the-top confections, and wedding cakes as big as the day itself. If you're looking for a wedding day sweet treat to make your guests' jaws drop (and stomachs rumble), you've definitely come to the right place... END
BEGIN HERE These extravagant confections have got us ohh'ing and ahh'ing, and practically drooling. From towering tiers to a garden's worth of floral decorations, these wedding cakes are a princess bride's dream come true. Totally fit for royalty (even Kate Middleton would be jealous!), these big day sweets make for an unforgettable finish to luxe, lavish nuptials. END
BEGIN HERE "A memorable cake can pull all the aesthetics of a wedding into a unifying focal point," says cake couturier Penny Stankiewicz of Brooklyn's Sugar Couture Cakes. "It's not only a cake — it's décor." And decadent décor at that! END

BEGIN HERE While most of your wedding-planning energy goes into the reception, it would really just be a party without the ceremony. After all, that's the part where you get married! And it's a lot more than simply saying "I do" — there are hours of conversations, considerations, and choice-making that go into creating a ceremony that fits who you are as a couple (and enable your officiant to tell the story of your relationship before you say your vows). But what happens when, after all that planning, your priest or rabbi is unable to perform the ceremony when your wedding day arrives? Here are a few tips from our experts to help ensure your ceremony is still incredibly special. END
BEGIN HERE Whether it's a family emergency or another parishioner at your church is in need of the priest's support and guidance, being paired with a new officiant at the last minute could throw a wrench into your carefully crafted plans. The good thing is that it doesn't have to. END
BEGIN HERE Spend a few minutes with your new officiant in private at your rehearsal. Walk through the ceremony script you've created, and explain any references or stories that might not be immediately clear to someone who doesn't know the history of your relationship. If you have a little time, put together a brief synopsis of how you met and fell in love, the things that matter most to the two of you, and why you've decided to get married. (You can also direct him or her toward your wedding website!) While it won't be the in-depth backstory your original officiant had, it will help your new officiant provide context and a more personal spin on the next day's proceedings. END
BEGIN HERE  Do We Have to Invite Our Officiant to the Reception? END
BEGIN HERE You may also want to have a full rehearsal of the ceremony instead of just practicing walking down the aisle. You can skip over things like longer readings and your personalized vows, but have your officiant read through the rest of the script to get familiar with what you've put together. This is also a great opportunity to make sure he or she knows how to correctly pronounce everyone's names, as well as who to cue for different readings or rituals you've included. Review where everyone should stand, which way you're facing, and any moments when the two of you will need to walk to a different part of the altar. END
BEGIN HERE Remember that, even though this person isn't the officiant you'd originally chose, they've performed weddings before and will be able to officiate yours with the fewest hiccups possible. Then focus on repeating your vows, exchanging rings, and that first kiss! END
BEGIN HERE If your fiancé and his friends are like most men (clueless when it comes to skin), they're probably thinking the only beauty prepping they need is a haircut a couple weeks in advance and quick shave on the morning of the big day. And well, that's where they'd be dead wrong! We turned to Skin Coach Celeste Hilling, CEO of Skin Authority, to get the scoop on exactly what your groom and his guys should do to get all groomed up for the wedding. Feel free to pass this piece along (hint, hint men!). END
BEGIN HERE   Yep, you read that right! Stock up on some oils, especially ones that contain vitamin D to thicken and smooth beard hair before the big day, says Hilling. "You can rub the oils in your hair as well as an at-home scalp treatment." END
BEGIN HERE She's your best friend, confidant, partner in crime, therapist, life coach, pseudo wedding planner... The list goes on and on. And sure, it's an honor in and of itself to be selected as a maid of honor since by choosing your best girl for this role, you're essentially identifying her as the most important friend or family member who's closest to your heart. Yet, this honor also comes with a pretty hefty job description and expectations — it's no easy task. So, here are a few ways to honor your maid of honor on your wedding day — because she totally deserves it. END

BEGIN HERE   Not all couples speak at their weddings but for those that choose to express their gratitude on their big day, be sure to mention her! From the moment you got engaged she has been by your side (and chances are, she has been there through much, much more, too.) and to verbally express what that has meant to you, will mean the world to her. Some couples opt to do this speech at their rehearsal dinner, in a more intimate setting. Even better! A simple, verbalized thank you can go a long way, especially since she will be delivering an entire MOH speech for you! (Matron of honor thank-you note, $2.25, TresElephantsDesign available on Esty) END
BEGIN HERE There isn't a bride-to-be around who doesn't want to look her best for her big day.

BEGIN HERE One moment that truly brings all of your wedding guests together is the traditional champagne toast. Everyone at the wedding takes a moment to raise a glass of bubbly in the air and in unison, cheers to the happiness and love you'll experience in the future. While traditionally, champagne has been the drink of choice for this toast, it doesn't have to be. Not a fan of the sparkling stuff? Spice it up with these four alternatives. END
BEGIN HERE   Instead of setting one specific drink you'd like all your guests to toast with, have them choose what they like. Let them toast with whatever they are actually drinking. This is a great way to keep it personal and also inviting for your guests to want to join in and participate. END

BEGIN HERE If wearing lingerie were a sporting event, the evening of your wedding day would be the Superbowl. In the old days, the wedding night might be the first time a bride and groom saw each other naked, much less had sex. END
BEGIN HERE These days — unless religious traditions or moral convictions have kept you from taking each other out for a test drive — you and your new husband will probably already have a rich sex life before you tie the knot. For you, wedding night lingerie is a more of an added spice — an amuse bouche, if you will, before the main meal. END
BEGIN HERE So what should you wear for the big night? Well, speaking as the representatives of all men in the universe, we at the Plunge have the answer... We have no idea what you should wear. END
BEGIN HERE When it comes to sexy lingerie, men don't really have a lot to offer in terms of practical advice. That might not seem to make sense, as lingerie is, supposedly, created with us in mind. But for men, lingerie is kind of like Ecstacy... We don't really know how it's made, but we like the effect it has on us. END
BEGIN HERE You, on the other hand, are there in the lab, smashing the molecules together, mixing and matching different frilly, lacy underthings to get the perfect sexy look. END
BEGIN HERE If we were to give advice, it would be this: get something that you like, something that makes you feel comfortable and sexy. It doesn't have to be an elaborate bustier and garter belt combo. Some of us actually prefer the casual approach ("boyfriend" shirt and librarian glasses, for instance). The sexier you feel, the sexier we'll find you. END
BEGIN HERE On the other hand, the wedding night and honeymoon is a great excuse for stocking up on stockings...and bras, panties, garter belts, teddies, body bows, naughty knickers and teeny-weenie monokinis. You don't even have to spend your own money. You can get your friends to buy you what you want by putting everything on a registry. END
BEGIN HERE We know what you're thinking: I don't want to put lingerie on my wedding registry. I don't want my dad, my uncles, my mother, or my fiancé's groomsmen to know what I'm wearing underneath the wedding dress. That's perfectly reasonable. You need a registry devoted only to lingerie. We have one to recommend. It's called OuiHours. END
BEGIN HERE A shoppable online lingerie magazine and registry like OuiHours allows you to pick the lacy underthings you want and share them with the small circle of people from whom you might actually want to receive a lacy underthing — your best friends, maybe, or your bridesmaids. It's a silver bullet for bachelorette parties or bridal showers and for the more adventurous bride, the big day in order to avoid gag gifts and lingerie that looks like a gag gifts.  END

BEGIN HERE Better yet, it will allow your man to buy you something naughty, and he'll know it's something you'll actually wear. He won't make the mistake of getting something too small ("How am I supposed to fit into that?"), something too big ("Oh my God! You must think I'm an elephant!"), or something too filthy ("Are you out of your MIND? I'm not letting you put that on me!"). END

BEGIN HERE Our hearts are still reeling from hearing the news that one of Hollywood's sweetest duos, Drew Barrymore and Will Kopelman, have called it quits after four years of marriage. The couple announced their split just over two weeks ago, releasing a joint public statement that stated, "Sadly our family is separating legally, although we do not feel this takes away from us being a family. Divorce might make one feel like a failure, but eventually you start to find grace in the idea that life goes on." Although we're still not over the fact that the too-short love story between this seemingly-perfect pair has come to a close (it's a healing process, okay...), it's nice to see that both Drew and Will are embracing the fact that life does indeed go on. A surefire sign that Drew is moving forward? Her brand new finger bling! Yes, Barrymore has officially ditched her wedding ring for an alternative piece of jewelry she's toting on that finger. And we're actually loving it... END
BEGIN HERE When Barrymore and Kopelman wed in a charming backyard wedding back in 2012, the groom presented his bride with a delicate vintage wedding band, subtly adorned with pretty pavé diamonds. But with the news of the couple's split, that ring has been assumedly tucked away in a jewelry box and Barrymore has been rocking another super meaningful piece around town. END

BEGIN HERE We know that Caitlyn Jenner had some Say Yes to the Dress moments recently, twirling around in wedding dresses on a recent I Am Cait episode, but perhaps there was a good reason (more so than trying on wedding dresses is just SO much fun)? In Sunday's episode of I Am Cait, the 66-year-old and her ex-wife, Kris Jenner, have an emotional conversation reflecting on their marriage and Caitlyn's transition. During it, Caitlyn shares — to a very surprised Kris Jenner — that she wants to possibly renew their vows at some point. END
BEGIN HERE Kris seemed shocked by this relevation from her ex, and then said in typical Kardashian fashion, "What? Do I get another diamond?" The difference this time: Caitlyn wants a diamond, too, according to People. This exchange happened when the two were discussing the former Olympian's name change and the legal documents that have been changed to reflect her new gender. END
BEGIN HERE The lengthy conversation between the two came just two and a half years after they announced their split in October 2013. "I just want to apologize for a lot of the times the way I acted. It didn't have to be that way. I think going forward from here, I would always want you in my life, " Caitlyn opened up to Kris during the episode. The two appear to be in a good place, with Caitlyn saying that although she "has a very different relationship" with Kris, there is hope that it "can be a really good relationship." END
BEGIN HERE Considering their history, family ties, and very public social life, we know this isn't the last we'll be hearing from these two about the topic.

BEGIN HERE While shopping for a mother of the bride dress for your own mom can be nearly as fun as picking out your own wedding dress, helping the mother of the groom figure out what to wear is a little more challenging.

BEGIN HERE Tradition states that both mothers wear coordinated outfits — often matching the wedding's color scheme — and that the mother of the bride should select her attire first, which will then be used to inspire and guide what the mother of the groom chooses to wear. If you're having a formal or more traditional wedding, chances are your future mother-in-law is expecting this, so once you're done shopping with Mom, let your groom's mother know what your mom has selected and provide any important guidelines. Should she feel free to wear a cocktail dress even if your mom's is floor-length, or choose a pair of flats or wedges instead of skinny stilettos? Or would you prefer that she wear a lighter hue of blue to complement your mom's navy frock? A little pre-shopping guidance will probably be much-appreciated. END
BEGIN HERE  5 Tips for Helping the Mother of the Bride Find Her Dress END
BEGIN HERE When it comes time to shop, your involvement depends on how close you are with your mother-in-law, both emotionally and physically. If you're close pals and live in the same city, plan a weekend afternoon shopping trip, with either a girls' lunch beforehand or a happy hour cocktail after. If you're still getting to know one another, this could be a great time to really bond, too! But don't fret if the two of you live far apart. She could ask an associate at the store to snap pictures of the options for you to see, or you could trust her fashion sense and let her pick something she loves. END
BEGIN HERE Whichever way you choose to do it, remember to be respectful and sensitive. As long as your mother-in-law's dress fits your vision (even if it's not what you had on your Pinterest board) and isn't the same gown your own mom picked, she'll be happy and will feel fabulous, which will shine extra brightly in those portraits, no matter what the dress looks like!

BEGIN HERE The couple honeymooned in Napa Valley and Maui before returning home. Reflecting on their wedding day, Lindsay offers up this advice to brides-to-be: "Stay true to your vision, don't get swept away in the opinions of others. It's easy to get pulled away in different directions, but ultimately this is a day about the two of you." END

BEGIN HERE We can't get enough of engaged-to-be-married duo Jason Sudeikis, Olivia Wilde, or their beyond-words-adorable little family. (Once we learned that their two-year-old son, Otis, had a bit of a Beyoncé obsession, we were pretty much sold.) And lucky for us, we'll be getting to see even more of this terrific threesome as they grow into a fabulous foursome. Yes, Wilde and Sudeikis are expecting once again! The actress just announced the joyous news on her Instagram page today — with a baby bump pic, no less! END
BEGIN HERE "Matching baby bumps," the Vinyl star wrote on social media on Monday. In the super sweet snapshot (below), Wilde can be seen sitting on a bed with her little one, Otis, both of them cradling their tummies and Wilde revealing for the first time her mom-to-be belly. Already rocking the sympathy bump, it definitely looks like Otis is going to be quite the mommy's little helper and one heck of a big brother to boot! END
BEGIN HERE "I'm desperate for more [kids]!" Wilde previously shared with People magazine, stating that she and her almost-hubby, Sudeikis, definitely want to give Otis a sibling. "I love my siblings so much and Jason has incredible siblings too. The more the merrier." If this means we get to see even more can't-stand-it cuteness from these two, we definitely agree! END
BEGIN HERE But the addition of another tiny tot doesn't mean that Wilde and Sudeikis are planning to race down that aisle. This fan-favorite couple has been engaged since 2013 and seem pretty content with their current relationship status. But the former Saturday Night Live actor recently revealed their tentative wedding date on Watch What Happens Live and, we must say, we'd expect nothing less from the comedian. "I believe we won't get married until weed is legal in every state," Sudeikis hilariously stated. END
BEGIN HERE Okay so chances are, Wilde and Sudeikis will probably wait to tie the knot, but if the occasion calls for it, might we suggest some bridal maternity styles in case she decides to head down that aisle with her baby bump in tow? We're here if you need us, Olivia! END

BEGIN HERE When it comes to weddings, there's one thing you can count on: Nothing gets guests going like good food and drink. It's often what they remember most, actually (that and the music). END
BEGIN HERE To up your reception game, work with the chef at your venue or catering company to create a custom menu that reflects your tastes as a couple. It's likewise important to give your wines a think—in fact, it's becoming the norm to pair specific varietals with personalized dishes, the same way restaurants have done for years. END
BEGIN HERE But assuming you don't have a sommelier on speed-dial, how do you know what works best with steak versus fish? Enter Yoav Gilat, co-founder of Cannonball Wine Company, one of our favorite industry insiders, whose Healdsburg, California-based winemakers turn out some of the most delicious vintages on the market. (Bonus: most retail for less than $20!) Not only do they produce four unique varietals under the Cannonball brand—Cabernet, Chardonnay, Merlot, and Sauvignon Blanc—they also oversee a Proprietary Red and a Rosé under sister brand, Angels & Cowboys (talk about a wine label that will get guests talking at the bar!). END
BEGIN HERE To ensure a standout wine-paired meal, consider these five tips from Gilat: END
BEGIN HERE  And of course, if you're doing a buffet style meal, why not channel the same serve-yourself approach and offer one versatile white and red that guests can self-pour? Just place a bottle of each on the table and let them do their thing. The interactive touch will be reminiscent of a restaurant experience, making your reception less big-banquet and more unique and memorable. END
BEGIN HERE You wanted to write your own wedding vows. But now that it's time to put pen to paper, you're at a loss for the words you so desperately need. Take heart: Other couples have been where you are, and yet found inspiration in unique and unexpected places. Here, four brides and grooms share what inspired them to express their love for their spouses. END
BEGIN HERE   Cassie found herself planning her own wedding just two years after her mother remarried. "I got to be her maid of honor, which was such a special experience," she says. But that meant Cassie also had a front-seat to hear her mother's handwritten vows. "My mom said the most beautiful things about what it truly takes to make a marriage work," Cassie recalls. "And because she was divorced, I figured she was in an excellent position to know what promises really matter. When I wrote my own vows, I tried to make similar promises to my husband."  END
BEGIN HERE You may have tulle and lace dancing in your head as you turn in with your soon-to-be-hubby, but your friends going to bed solo probably have other things on their minds... The truth is, that despite how supporting your single gal pals are of your engagement and all that wedding planning chaos, some of them might be getting their fill of all the seating chart talk and lovey-dovey stuff you can't stop spilling. Even worse? Some of your friends' feelings might be getting hurt every time you flash your new bling, reminding them that they're still single. END
BEGIN HERE No bride wants bum out her besties, so here are a few helpful tips for staying sensitive to your single ladies while knee-deep in wedding planning. END
BEGIN HERE   Your choice for the maid of honor is a really important one to you and everyone else because it says this is the most important person in your wedding party, besides your soon-to-be-spouse, of course. Even if you are very clear it will be your sister or your best friend, a lot of times your other friends will wonder why they weren't picked and, as a result, may take it very personally that you didn't select them. Old friends can get upset if you choose a new friend, new friends can get upset when you choose an old friend, friends can get upset when you choose a sister, and sisters can get upset when you choose a friend. So when you are deciding who will be your maid of honor and there are a number of possible choices, let them each know how special they are to you, which is why they are part of your wedding party. Reassure them that just because they are not the maid of honor, they hold a cherished place of importance and are, in fact, a big part of your momentous day. END

BEGIN HERE Between friends' and family members' celebrations, chances are you've already experienced many of the area's tried-and-true wedding venues before — maybe more than once. So the prospect of throwing your big bash in a shiny new space is all the more appealing, especially for a bride who wants to make a trendsetting splash. Here are some of Chicago's newest wedding venues that are perfect for a trendsetting bride-to-be. END

BEGIN HERE A lot of couples don't want to do a traditional wedding registry — they've already got their homes, and they've outfitted them with the things they want. They don't feel the need to stock up on Waterford crystal and their grandmother's sterling pattern, much less have to find a place to store 16 place settings of china that can't go in the microwave or dishwasher. END
BEGIN HERE That's okay. You don't have to do a traditional wedding registry anymore. It's not just about registering for china and linens at a well-known department store — you can register for home improvements, trips (and not just your honeymoon), and even major lifestyle items such as in vitro fertilization or a down payment on your first home. Here are some of my favorite nontraditional registry options. END
BEGIN HERE   There are several sites that let you create your own categories, but Zola is pretty spectacular. You can register for some traditional stuff to make your parents happy, but you can also translate the gifts into "experiences" like fancy fresh food deliveries from Blue Apron, or monthly wine or beer subscriptions. They have a "fund" section where you can literally create any category you like, so that your wedding guests can help you pay for the things you dream about. My professional opinion? You might have to be a bit careful how you promote this sort of registry so you don't appear to be doing a cash-grab, but for your friends in-the-know, this is a great way for them to help you learn to skydive or start a family.

BEGIN HERE When a Canadian bride and groom were tying the knot, they decided that someone's nephew or little cousin just wasn't unique enough to take on their ring bearing duties and instead choose to recruit a trained owl to serve as their ring bearer. A dream detail for any Harry Potter fan, right? Well, actually not so much... Instead, that winged member of their wedding party ended up bringing a whole new meaning to the term 'wedding crasher.' END
BEGIN HERE Whether a bride has always dreamed of walking down the aisle, being led by her childhood dog or groom knows no better best man than man's best friend, tons of couples are including their furriest of friends in their wedding ceremonies, nowadays. We've seen everything from puppies in miniature bow ties, kitties with their own flower crowns, and even horses pulling fairytale-worthy carriages, and we can't help but smile at all of the wet noses and wagging tail cuteness these furry wedding guests bring to the whole affair. But the thing about having animals at your wedding is that they're, well, animals, prone to getting frightened, distracted, or just plain bored. END
BEGIN HERE No matter how much you painstakingly plan, animals tend to be a little unpredictable and are sometimes prone to hilarious — and mildly-horrifying — wedding bloopers (just like humans, now that we think about it...). That's just what happened at a recent Canadian wedding ceremony where a ring bearer owl made a not-so-graceful landing — straight into a glass window. END
BEGIN HERE The plan apparently was that the owl, Max, was to fly from the arm of his trainer and to the bride and groom, to complete his ring bearing duties. But apparently, the winged creature smelled sweet, sweet freedom and instead decided to go rogue, taking off for a nearby window that the poor thing didn't realize was actually closed. In what basically could've been a commercial spot for Windex, Max took off and crashed head-on into the glass — ending his majestic flight with a terrifying thud. The drawn-out "Ohhh's," from the wedding guests as Max fell straight to the floor are what really make the whole thing uber-cringe-worthy. (Besides the unconscious owl lying on the floor in the middle of a wedding, of course...) END
BEGIN HERE But, have no fear. According to Time, good old Max supposedly survived the crash and will live to fly another day. He'll probably not get invited to anymore weddings though... END
BEGIN HERE  The Wackiest Pets that Have Walked Down the Aisle END
BEGIN HERE You did it! You've been pronounced husband and wife, you've danced the night away and you have memories and photos that will last a lifetime. But then, those few minutes of newlywed bliss fade into the background as a pounding headache, nausea and exhaustion set in. This is the reality for all too many brides who end up suffering a hangover the morning after their wedding. The good news is, you don't have to be one of them. Yes, you can indulge a bit at your own wedding and still wake up for your first day as a Mrs. on cloud nine and feeling fine (and married!) by following these tips. END
BEGIN HERE   Throughout the night you will be pulled in so many different directions; for photo ops, to the dance floor, meet and greets — it doesn't end! Chances are, you'll be putting your drink down (and losing it) tons of times throughout the night, and then refilling again. This is an easy way to loose track of just how much you've had, leading to unintended overindulgence. Try your best to keep track of your consumption throughout the night. It might not feel like you've had much at all, but those sips add up quite quickly! END
BEGIN HERE With so many gorgeous hairstyles to choose from for your wedding day, it can be overwhelming to narrow it down to just one look. The right hairstyle should not only be special, but seamlessly fit with your makeup, jewelry, dress, and, of course, your wedding theme. From traditional to boho, we've narrowed down the best hairstyles to go with your wedding theme! END
BEGIN HERE   Casual, tousled waves are ideal for a laid-back beach affair. Like the beach, this carefree look is relaxed, and in tune with both the ocean's rolling waves, and the ceremony's light atmosphere. Plus, they won't run the risk of falling due to a balmy breeze the way curls or an updo would. While this style is far from elaborate and best slightly messy, do ask your hairstylist to use a serum or spray that helps fight frizz in the humidity. A sea salt spray will also help give you that sought-after beachy texture. END
BEGIN HERE Baby news is seriously buzzing in Hollywood right now! Between the birth of Chrissy Teigen and John Legend's little girl, Luna — and from what we just heard she sounds adorable! — and expectant news coming from both Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds as well as Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes (those kids are, like, already in competition for most attractive), we can hardly keep up! But luckily, we are. The latest in celebrity baby news today? Behati Prinsloo and Adam Levine are expecting a little girl! END
BEGIN HERE While the news of the couple expecting their first child together broke a little over a month ago, this is time we're hearing that the duo is expecting a daughter. Multiple sources confirmed the news to E!, adding that the Victoria's Secret model is almost five months along and is planning her baby shower. Sources also reported that the duo is selling their homes in New York and Los Angeles and are looking for a more family-friendly abode. END
BEGIN HERE In mid-March multiple sources confirmed that the adorable duo is expecting, and earlier this month the "Sugar" singer and soon-to-be dad confirmed the baby news himself. Levine shared an Instagram snap of his supermodel wife lounging around on a poolside chair, wearing an L.A. Lakers hat and a tiny red bikini — with her mini baby bump in full view! "My two favorite Laker fans, " the Maroon 5 frontman captioned the pic. And just in case you couldn't figure out who that second Laker fan was, Levin added the baby, milk bottle, and basketball emojis for good measure. END
BEGIN HERE While it may be just a tad too early to already be choosing the unborn's favorite sports teams (although we do appreciate the enthusiasm, Levin!), it is definitely never too early to get excited for the arrival of this itsy bitsy angel — or start thinking of giving their little girl some brothers and sisters "I want to have 100 kids," Levine once said. "I want to have more kids than would be socially responsible." 99 more to go, you two! END
BEGIN HERE Even Taylor Swift, Hollywood's iconic, all-American girl, is prone to making a mistake every now and then. After the "Bad Blood" singer traveled all the way to Coachella to show off her new platinum 'do and hang out with her bae, Calvin Harris, she put on her superwoman cape to attend her backup singer's wedding in Texas — all in the same day. Can we get a resounding "DAYUMM"? END
BEGIN HERE But surprisingly, what really shocked the Internet wasn't T-Swift's commitment to see her friend tie the knot and ALSO attend her boyfriend's can't-miss show later that evening in another state, it was the fact that she showed up to said wedding in a major nuptials faux pas. As evidenced by sneaky pictures posted to Twitter, the singer appears to have donned a long-sleeve, white sheath dress (photos below), turning heads not only because she looked fab (naturally), but because who wears white to a friend's wedding?! END
BEGIN HERE The bride didn't seem to care at all though, according to AOL. And why would she? Swifty showed up to her wedding despite the fact that the trendiest musical festival in the U.S. was currently taking place in Palm Springs. Rather than sipping on cocktails and jamming to Sia or the 1975, the singer dropped her squad to witness something much more beautiful than a barrage of flower crowns —  END
BEGIN HERE The wedding reception seating chart is an oft-dreaded task that makes brides and grooms cringe. Even with the most fool-proof approaches, high-tech programs, and tried-and-true advice, there's still an emotional aspect to the process that adds an extra dose of stress, no matter how prepared you are. But thankfully, some questions are easier to answer than others! If you're one of a slew of cousins in the same age group or are super close to your second cousin who's barely in her 30s, do you have to seat them with the rest of your relatives, or can you mix them in with your BFFs and college roomies? Here's what our experts have to say. END
BEGIN HERE The great thing about seating charts (trust us, they're not all bad!) is that, beyond the basic rules about where to seat your immediate families, you're free to mix things up as much as you want. If your cousin is shy and would be more comfortable sitting with her parents, but you know she'll love your fiancé's sister, seat her with family and make a point to introduce the two of them during cocktail hour. On the other hand, if you've got relatives who are the life of the party (or who have even met some of your friends before), there's no rule saying they can't all sit together. Mix the tables up based on personalities and common interests, regardless of how you're related. Just make them promise you'll hear all the hilarious stories during your morning-after brunch! END
BEGIN HERE  How to Have a Successful Seated Dinner Without a Seating Chart END
BEGIN HERE If you're having a more formal event, or think older relatives might be confused by the splitting up of families, consider keeping your family members together but placing a table full of cousins and younger relatives next to the table where your college pals are seated. Even if they're not all sitting together, there's no way the laughter and fun won't spread between tables — be prepared for a little seat-swapping! END
BEGIN HERE Many brides with a glam and glitzy side dream of their wedding day in part because it's the one 24 hour span where it's socially acceptable to look and act like a total princess. Even if you're not particularly into the whole fairytale wedding fantasy, it's not hard to feel like royalty while wearing all that tulle and lace, with all of your wedding guests fawning over you and your brand new hubby. But while you're busy being princess for a day, you might forget that that would make your groom royalty, as well. One groom who definitely didn't forget his claim to the throne is Seattle Seahawks player Earl Thomas, who donned a full-on cape and king's crown for his recent wedding. Seriously. END
BEGIN HERE Even Prince William didn't don this much regal-wear for his royal wedding! Over this past weekend, Thomas wed his high school sweetheart, Nina Heisser, at Houston's Chateau Cocomar, a particularly posh wedding venue that almost looks palace-like with its sprawling grounds and Versailles-inspired mansion. So, fittingly for the castle-esque venue, the NFL star headed down the aisle to tie the knot wearing a tux fit for a king, thanks to his blinged-out headwear and floor-length cape. END
BEGIN HERE We've seen tons of brides wear tiaras for their "I do's," but this actually might be a first for us... While the bride looked regal enough in a full tulle ball gown (sans crown), the groom went all out with his wedding-wear in a crown and cape that he wore for the ceremony, photos, and even the reception — until he ripped both it and his shirt off for an impromptu dance performance, that is. Watch the wedding video below and you'll see what we mean... END
BEGIN HERE According to the short compilation video and photos Thomas posted on his Instagram page, while this wedding was sans any actual monarchy members, there were definitely some Hollywood royalty in attendance. Ciara was there alongside her fiancé, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, as well as various other NFL stars, who all looked like they were digging Thomas' outfit of choice. Wonder if this means Russell Wilson will be donning something similar for his and Ciara's big day. (If so, we vote for a matching tiara for the bride...) END

BEGIN HERE You've always dreamed of a beachy honeymoon locale, but the new Mr. is more about the mountains. Luckily this is one of the easiest newlywed compromises you'll have to make. Jet off to the South of France and embark on a road trip along the Côte d'Azur, spending your days lounging at beach clubs sipping rosé and cruising through the lavender-lined roads of Provence. You'll instantly feel all that post-wedding stress slip away as you're hiking up hills that inspired the work of artists like Matisse and sleeping in the most charming B&Bs in tucked-away villages that look like a scene straight out of "Beauty and the Beast." Here's how to soak up the most of the countryside and sea on a romantic roadtrip through the South of France. END
BEGIN HERE   About two and a half hours away, all signs of city life seep away as you drive through a series of small villages and nature parks arriving at the forest-encased, Domaine de Manville, a former farmhouse that's been transformed into a 30-room luxury hotel. With all the amenities of a resort but with the feel of a countryside manor, the hotel is the perfect place to completely zen out with your other half — indulging in days by the open-air pool surrounded by olive trees; spa treatments with products crafted from locally sourced ingredients; and candlelit dinners on the terrace prepared by the domaine's Chef Dupuis-Baumal, who's worked alongside the best at Michelin-starred spots around the country. END
BEGIN HERE There's a scary rumor floating around: some couples don't get down on their wedding nights. If you've heard it, you might be wondering whether it's time to take up-front action, choosing to schedule a quickie for your big day to cut off the risk you won't have sex at all. Here, our experts help you figure out if a wedding-night quickie is right for you. END
BEGIN HERE First, says Carol Queen, Ph.D., sexologist and author of The Sex & Pleasure Book: Good Vibrations Guide to Great Sex for Everyone, consider that a wedding-night quickie doesn't have to be of the we're-giving-up-on-good-sex variety. In other words, you can still have amazing wedding night sex, even if you go for the fast finish. END
BEGIN HERE "A quickie is a much more realistic plan to cap off one of our modern full-production-number weddings where the happy couple are effectively hosting a huge party and are expected to expend a lot of energy on it," Queen explains. "Get too tipsy and it is not possible to have an optimal sexy celebration together, and planning not to do it may take the pressure off and allay any sense of disappointment that might otherwise have been felt. Planning a quickie takes that disappointment right off the menu." END
BEGIN HERE  Do You Need to Have Sex on Your Wedding Night? END
BEGIN HERE Kat Van Kirk, certified sex therapist and author of The Married Sex Solution: A Realistic Guide to Saving Your Sex Life, agrees. "Quickie sex can help remove the stress and expectation of sex, especially wedding night sex," she says. "Quickie sex is still physical connection and a way to commemorate your wedding night. Plus it lends itself to fun, creativity and spontaneity. It doesn't have to be your default pattern but can be a great tool in helping you to enjoy your sex life for exactly what it is." END
BEGIN HERE But that doesn't make a wedding-night quickie right for every newly-married couple. "For some, a quickie just will not do," says Queen. Who are these people or couples? They're the ones who "want a big perfect romance novel deflowering or Tantric ritual," Queen describes. "A quickie is just too 'normal' for this type of person, not special enough, and it's super-important to determine whether either partner has this kind of emotional build-up about the wedding night. If it makes either one truly feel like they had a substandard wedding night, that's a bad first step into the marriage." END
BEGIN HERE Plus, if you don't talk about your quickie plan before the big day, you could be setting yourself up for disappointment, Van Kirk points out. "If you don't discuss it as a couple ahead of time, one of you may interpret that a wedding night quickie could only be a negative thing, and who needs to start their wedded bliss like that?" Van Kirk says. So if you can't talk about wanting a quickie up-front with your partner, it's probably best not to plan for one. END
BEGIN HERE In August 2011, just over two years after they first met while working at Baltimore's Woodberry Kitchen, Jackie Beal and Corey Poloyka celebrated their first night in their first home together. The milestone was made even more memorable when Corey popped the question and the newly-engaged pair began dreaming of their September 13, 2014, wedding. The couple teamed up with the bride's mother Deanna Beal, and her friend, former event planner, Laura Yockel, to coordinate their stunning day at Holbrook Hollow Farm in Reisterstown, Maryland. "Corey and I wanted an elegant, outdoor estate setting," Jackie says, and their farm venue (which just so happens to be the home of the bride's best friend Alex Wooden and his family!) was the perfect property to bring that vision to life. END
BEGIN HERE "It was wonderful for me to get married on the farm, which is filled with memories from growing up," Jackie says. Drawing inspiration from the natural beauty of the property, the bride and groom planned a vintage-inspired celebration with a foodie twist. Read on to see every moment of their open-air nuptials and farm-to-table reception, as captured by photographer Lindsay Hite of Readyluck. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Lindsay Hite of Readyluck    END
BEGIN HERE Jackie already had plenty of happy memories with friends at Holbrook Hollow Farm, so it was the groom's turn to enjoy the property with his pals. Corey and his groomsmen spent the wedding morning shooting clay pigeons over the pond. END
BEGIN HERE It was important to both the bride and groom that they wed in a gorgeous outdoor space, and the expansive, elegant lawns at at Holbrook Hollow Farm home were just what they wanted. "We had spectacular views of their three-acre lake throughout the day," the bride says. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Lindsay Hite of Readyluck    END
BEGIN HERE Jackie's striking strapless lace Legends by Romona Keveza wedding dress was the very first wedding dress she tried on while shopping with her mom and sister. A beaded belt, blue satin Badgley Mischka heels, and a birdcage veil completed her look. For a personal touch, the bride wore a gold maple leaf in her hair, a gift from the Canadian groom's aunt. END
BEGIN HERE She went totally classic with a white and blush bouquet of garden roses, dahlias, and spray roses. END
BEGIN HERE When it came to picking dresses for her bridesmaids, Jackie only considered options she felt confident her attendants would be able to wear again. Their navy lace Adrianna Pappell dresses were beautiful at the wedding and were versatile enough for future formal occasions. Jackie kept their arrangements simple and sweet; each 'maid carried a fluffy bundle of baby's breath. END
BEGIN HERE Corey and his groomsmen all donned dark grey pinstriped suits, but the groom stood out thanks to his gray and white wide-striped tie. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Lindsay Hite of Readyluck    END
BEGIN HERE As one of two flower girls, the couple's two-year-old daughter Michaela was enthusiastic about being a part of her parents' big day. Both young attendants wore light pink satin dresses with a chiffon overlay and ivory belt. Each donned a baby's breath flower crown and carried baskets filled with pink rose petals. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Lindsay Hite of Readyluck    END
BEGIN HERE The large side yard of the farm offered a unique setting for the ceremony. The couple exchanged vows in front of a partially built garden house with an expansive lawn behind them. Guests were seated in church pews along an aisle decorated with apple crates filled with ivory mums, the ideal accents for an early fall wedding. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Lindsay Hite of Readyluck    END
BEGIN HERE Minutes before the ceremony was set to begin, Michaela ran onto the front lawn for all the guests to see. The bride's mother and sister ran after the precocious flower girl and brought her back inside so that the processional could begin with a proper introduction of the bride. Once order was restored, Jackie's father walked her down the aisle while a classic Louis Armstrong album played on a vintage record player. END
BEGIN HERE During the ceremony, the bride's best friend, groomsman Alex Wooden, read the lyrics to "Everything" by Michael Bublé. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Lindsay Hite of Readyluck    END
BEGIN HERE Cocktail hour moved guests from the side yard to another outdoor space where everyone could enjoy oysters and drinks. Then, the party moved to a tent where friends and family could dance the night away with a breathtaking view of Holbrook Hollow's lake. Farm tables were arranged in a 'U' shape, with the bride and groom's head table placed front and center. Each table's focal point was an ivory lace table runner with a gorgeous centerpiece of blush, pink, and ivory flowers in silver revere bowls. END
BEGIN HERE Place settings utilized a mix of different vintage gold-rimmed plates and antique stemware that the mother of the bride contributed. Soft, glowing light came courtesy of ivory citronella candles, which were placed in each votive to ward off unwanted visitors. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Lindsay Hite of Readyluck    END
BEGIN HERE Guests sipped on the couple's signature cocktail, Government Mules, as they dined on a hand-picked menu.

BEGIN HERE  Registries aren't just for sheets and comforters — you can add shams to the list too! Choose pillow shams that compliment your bedding, but don't rely on registering for an already-put-together set. The price point might prevent guests from buying it for you. Instead, choose your own shams, any number between 3 and 6 depending on the size of your bed, in a few sizes and shapes for texture. END

BEGIN HERE   Women can multitask almost too well. "I see a lot of women who are mentally caught in their heads when trying to become intimate with themselves or others," says Michelle Herzog, LMFT and psychotherapist, who adds that common thoughts run the gamut from "I'm too fat" to "I feel gross about my body." But if you practice mindfulness before and after you hit the bedroom, you can "increase the mind-body connection and have more control over the negative self-talk that women seem to get caught up in," Herzog says. "And having the ability to be mindful and present with the sexual self and a partner are wonderful ways to increase sexual awareness and confidence." END
BEGIN HERE Right after settling on the dream dress, most brides begin stressing on how to style their tresses come the big day. (Trust us: We've written countless articles on the subject...) Should your hair be pulled back in a sleek bun to show off your shoulders, or down in romantic loose waves for a soft, boho look? It seems like the bridal beauty possibilities are endless, and hair trial after hair trial has lead many a bride to a pre-wedding meltdown. One woman who definitely wasn't stressing over her wedding day hairstyle? Joan Lyons, an inspiringly brave bride who actually shaved off all her hair — in the middle of her wedding! — in support of her husband, Craig, who is currently fighting terminal pancreatic cancer. END
BEGIN HERE This Liverpool couple has had quite the love story, after having known each other for 30 years before finally tying the knot. "I fell in love with her as soon as I set my eyes on her when we were 14," Craig shared with The Daily Mail. But it actually took quite awhile for the groom to finally confess his feelings. Just 18 months ago, Craig finally told his now-wife how he felt while aboard a ferry boat. (How very McDreamy of him...) END
BEGIN HERE Craig and Joan had planned to marry later this year, but when his condition was recently determined to be terminal, they decided to move their nuptials up to earlier this month, with the sweetest of wedding plans in mind. They would encourage their guests to donate to various charities in lieu of wedding gifts and to give their friends and family a little extra incentive, the bride decided she would shave her head — at her very own reception! END
BEGIN HERE After the couple said their "I dos," the big moment came. As a saxophonist played "Ferry Across the Mersey" — a nod to where their love story all began — Joan's hair was first cut (to be donated to the charity the Little Princess Trust, which creates wigs for children going through chemotherapy) and then her head was shaved as she sat there in her wedding dress. "I was really relaxed during the process," the bride later told CBS News. "Just thinking how thankful and privileged I was to be able to do this." END

BEGIN HERE The trip to parenthood for John Legend and Chrissy Teigen was a long one, but finally — their baby girl is here! And she couldn't be cuter. Luna Simone Stephens was born last Thursday, and since then, the singer/songwriter and his model-turned-cookbook author wife Chrissy Teigen have been busy with their newest (and most exciting) job — being parents. Cue the sleepless nights, diaper changes, impromptu feeding times, and of course: lots of baby photos. END

The sweet snap shows Teigen in a black home-from-the-hospital outfit outside soaking up some sun, holding her teeny, tiny newborn in a white blanket while Teigen's cute dog looks on. (We can only image he's probably a little jealous at all the attention their new family member is getting!) "Hi my lulu!" Teigen captioned the mom-and-daughter photo. Lulu! That nickname is too sweet. END

Chrissy and John can't stop gushing over Luna. She is perfect!" END
BEGIN HERE While this photo is no doubt adorable, we have yet to get a good look at little Lulu's face. But the source reported to E! that she looks like a beautiful mix of her mother's cute round cheeks with her father's features — sounds like the start to a baby modeling career to us! END
BEGIN HERE When it comes to their day-to-day routine thus far, it sounds like the pair has gotten right into a mom and dad mode — with Chrissy breastfeeding and sources say she will begin working out to lose her baby weight as soon as the doctor gives the 'go-ahead.' She even shared a snarky tweet about her husband's "recovery." END

BEGIN HERE We've been seeing all kinds of creative wedding signage lately, from beautiful welcome sign ideas to the most creative menus and Instagram hashtag designs. One of our favorite ideas? A pretty sign to mark the ceremony aisle. It's such a smart idea, too, especially if you have flower petals scattered down the length of the aisle and don't want guests to accidentally step on them. Here are seven of our favorite takes on this idea. END
BEGIN HERE  Spread the word about your hashtag by placing it prominently along the aisle so no one will miss it. END
BEGIN HERE Roses are red, violets are blue, and holy moly, flowers in general are crazy expensive too! Just ask your fiancé how much that pretty arrangement he got you for your birthday cost. Turns out, it probably wasn't cheap, nor will your wedding flowers be. But fortunately, there are ways you can nip that floral budget problem in the bud now. Here are eight ways to get the most bang for your buck. END
BEGIN HERE   When in doubt, ask your florist for some insight. According to event planner Kristine Cholakian Cooke, owner of Simply Charming Socials, she should be able to give you some great alternatives that meet your expectations visually and are also more accessible for your date. "We always find that brides who are more open-minded going into initial floral meetings can truly learn about flowers and options they didn't know existed. In the end, the results can be beautiful and unexpected." END

BEGIN HERE Lilo and Egor, it definitely (well, probably...) has a ring to it — pun intended! Even though the signs were there: emerald bling, an 8-month relationship, and a Page Six article, Lindsay Lohan's reps have been feverishly denying her alleged engagement to Egor Tarabasov. But with all that denying comes more possible proof — another source has just claimed to US Weekly that Lindsay Lohan and Egor Tarabasov are indeed engaged! END
BEGIN HERE The actress has recently been spotted with her Russian beau and new sparkler at several events — including a Duran Duran concert in Brooklyn (where she rocked out on stage with the band!), the 2016 Asian Awards in London, as well as separate outings with Lohan's mother, Dina Lohan, and her father, Michael Lohan. Hmm—smells like possible post-engagement celebrations to us! END
BEGIN HERE When it comes to the proposal, a source close to the couple alleged that it was done in London, where the Mean Girls star and her new fiancé live. As far as the bling goes, the 5-carat oval-shaped ring she's sporting wasn't a surprise; it was reported that the pair had been ring shopping previously and that the aspiring real estate mogul picked out the ring that Lohan wanted. END
BEGIN HERE Besides Lohan's social media shares, it's hard to find out much information about her maybe-fiancé since his Instagram is private, but word on the street is that he is son of Dmitry Tarabasov, who is a "wealthy man who owns a construction firm and a couple of stores similar to Home Depot in the Moscow region," according to The Daily Beast. Tarabasov's father is said to be less-than-thrilled with his son's new love and the attention it has been bringing his family. Conversely, it seems like the 24-year-old is Lohan family-approved, with both Dina and Michael stating that Lindsay seems happier than she's ever been. "He's not a good influence, he's a great influence," her father shared. END

Now the star of one of our favorite guilty pleasure reality shows, The Bachelorette, Fletcher is once again on the pursuit of that elusive Neil Lane diamond engagement ring (the swanky jewelry designer always creates the show's sparklers, don't you know...). But this time around, it's the guys who will have to do all the wooing. And apparently, JoJo is having one heck of a time! The first promo poster for season 12 of The Bachelorette has just dropped and JoJo looks totally jazzed about her second shot at love. END

BEGIN HERE Chances are, your wedding dress was something that you fell madly in love with the minute you tried it on for the first time. It was probably something you had to dig deep into your savings account to afford and will forever be the most expensive thing hanging in your closet. It's definitely one of the top things you will remember when you look back at your wedding memories. But as hard as it is, selling your white dress for some cold hard cash may be the right option for you. If so, here are four things to consider before putting your wedding dress up for sale. END

BEGIN HERE Planning a wedding is a big responsibility, and it can be hard to hand over the reins to some of your pre-wedding events, no matter what etiquette says. And it can be particularly challenging for low-key brides who are either planning a more casual wedding or don't love being the center of attention! So what's a bride to do when a well-meaning mom or aunt has big plans for a bridal shower but she'd prefer something more relaxed? Here's what our experts recommend. END
BEGIN HERE While you can't necessarily tell someone how to plan a party they're throwing you, and you want to avoid coming across as ungrateful, there are a few steps you can take to ensure that your bridal shower is something with which you're really comfortable. END
BEGIN HERE Before the planning begins, have a conversation with whomever is hosting. Let them know how appreciative you are, but also feel free to mention things you'd like to avoid (like a fancy brunch or a gathering for a huge crowd). The party is in your honor, after all, so the host should be receptive to suggestions that will make you feel comfortable. END
BEGIN HERE Once planning is underway, you might not know much of what is going on, especially since bridal showers are often surprise events. But that doesn't mean you can't send a few reminders through the grapevine! Gently remind the host (or your bridal party, who can spread the word for you) that you don't want her to spend too much money or plan something that's too complicated or involved. Put the focus on having a fun, comfortable celebration with the women you love, and ask her to leave it at that. END
BEGIN HERE And if you show up for lunch at your mom's house and SURPRISE! It's your bridal shower? Grin and bear it! Remember that all the effort was made to celebrate you and your marriage, so even if it's a bigger to-do than you'd wanted, it's all in the name of love. END

BEGIN HERE When Andrea Diaz downloaded Instagram back in 2012, she never suspected it would lead her to the love of her life. But sure enough, after posting adorable shots of her maltese dog to her account, Colin Chapin wound up following her page in a weird twist of fate. END
BEGIN HERE Chapin's BFF, Noah Meadors, actually was the first to find Diaz's account after searching for #maltesedogs on the app. A few days later, Chapin was scrolling through to see who his friends were following and, oddly enough, ended up taking a risk on following Diaz. END
BEGIN HERE "I followed them both back because I remember thinking, 'What's the harm? It's not as though we'll ever meet. They live in Indy!" Diaz, who was located in Florida at the time, told FOX59. END
BEGIN HERE The two strangers began leaving little comments on each other's photos, saying things like, 'Nice shot!' or 'Great photo,' but as time went on the comments began to reveal more intimate details about their lives. END
BEGIN HERE "At one point, our conversations grew so long that a simple photo of a landscape showed 30 comments, only it was us having silly, totally public conversations," Diaz told FOX59. END
BEGIN HERE  Real Brides Share: How He Proposed (and Caught it on Camera!) END
BEGIN HERE One thing led to another and the pair eventually exchanged phone numbers, which ended up leading to hours of conversation. The next major step in the couple's relationship was, naturally, meeting each other in person. But with the threat of catfishing so high (ahem, just watch the shady MTV show), Chapin was a teeny bit nervous about who Diaz could actually turn out to be. After landing in Florida though, those fears were quickly squelched, as you can see in their Instagram below! END
BEGIN HERE In August of 2013, Diaz packed up her bags and moved to Indianapolis to be closer to her beau. And by April of 2016, Chapin was ready to pop the question — but he obviously couldn't do it in regular fashion! So in lieu of their chance Instagram encounter, Chapin asked Diaz to marry him in an adorable Insta pic of the two of them on their first date. Can you say presh?! END

BEGIN HERE Australian model Nicole Trunfio, 30, and musician Gary Clark Jr., 32, fell in love at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival four years ago, so it was only fitting that the couple get back to the desert for their wedding day. With family, friends, and their one-year-old son, Zion, in tow, the pair made their union official last night, April 19, 2016, at the Colony Palms Hotel in Palm Springs, California. The newlyweds gave BRIDES an exclusive first look at their big day—including everything from the model bride's attire to their A-list musical performers. END
BEGIN HERE So why did they get married on a Tuesday? They were working around Gary's performance schedule: He was set to play both weekends at Coachella, so a mid-week party nearby was a no-brainer; guests arrived as early as Friday to take in the groom's concert and kick back with the pair before the big day.

For the ceremony, the model bride wore a beaded ball gown from Steven Khalil, complete with a plunging neckline and lengthy train. Her lace-trimmed Cathedral-length veil finished off her look. "I went through thousands of dresses, ideas, and custom designs to find something that was truly authentic to me and everything I dreamed about," Nicole says of finding her dress. "As a model, I don't usually get to choose the styles I wear on the day of a shoot, but on my wedding day I got to show off my style." END

"In the weeks after the formal, I couldn't stop thinking about her!" Philip says. Little did he know, Jenny was about to depart for a semester abroad in London. But their budding romance couldn't be stopped, and late night and early morning phone calls took the place of more "normal" dating. In November of 2011, Philip hopped a plane to London to spend Thanksgiving with Jenny, and he told her he loved her for the first time by the fountains in Trafalgar Square. Just over three years later, after the pair graduated and spent a year living in Dallas beginning their careers, Philip decided it was time to propose. With Jenny's father's blessing, he brought her to Pepperdine University in Malibu and, overlooking the Pacific Ocean and surrounded by roses and candles, Philip got down on one knee. END

BEGIN HERE Everybody knows the expression "game face" as it applies to everyday life. It means keeping your expression neutral — or positive — when things aren't going exactly as planned. For some careers, the ability to keep a "game face" can determine how long you keep that job. END
BEGIN HERE Keeping a "game face" at a wedding is just as important as it is in business. Perhaps more important, since there's no second chance, or redo, for your big day. Wedding planners have to do it all the time, and we know it's not easy. END
BEGIN HERE True fact: When the bride is happy at her wedding, everybody else is happy, too. The minute the groom, the mother of the bride, or her bridesmaids see that the bride is unhappy or upset about something, all bets are off. While the bride might be able to pull herself together and paste on a smile, even though her wedding bouquet is not what she ordered and it's too late to fix it, if everybody else around her gets worked up about a problem, the jig is up, and all hell breaks loose. END
BEGIN HERE Those who are "in the know" will not keep the bride's displeasure to themselves. They will tell other guests, who in turn, will become upset that the bride isn't happy. With liquid encouragement, some of them will take it upon themselves to admonish whatever wedding vendor they feel is appropriate, even though it's not their place to do so. And most of the time, they'll do it with an audience, so the drama grows. Now the breaking gossip is that the bride is upset and guests were yelling at the vendors about it during the wedding. Disaster! END
BEGIN HERE Yes, I'm putting the responsibility for keeping everybody else happy on the bride, to some degree. I'm not suggesting that if your minister doesn't show up, the cake falls over, or something else you can't avoid having the guests know about happens that you are responsible for making sure nobody else gets upset about the problem. Brides are human and sometimes they, justifiably, lose their cool. END
BEGIN HERE But when the issue is something that only the bride (and maybe a reasonable mom or bestie) knows about, the best approach is to keep a smile on your face, put it out of your mind, and deal with it after the wedding reception is over, and you get back from your honeymoon. Don't let somebody else's error ruin your wedding. END
BEGIN HERE Forget about the problem (maybe you'll laugh about it someday), keep smiling, and enjoy the rest of the things about your wedding day that are perfect. Don't let on to the guests that you're angry or upset unless you want to create drama at your wedding. You wouldn't believe how fast a mob mentality can grow when a bride isn't smiling. END

BEGIN HERE With more and more couples breaking with tradition and living together before engagement and marriage, bridal registries are following suit. While some couples choose to register for household items as upgrades to their current pieces, others are opting for something a bit more untraditional: the honeymoon registry. Increasing in popularity, there are many websites and honeymoon registry services popping up throughout the country, and it doesn't seem this trend is going anywhere anytime soon. (And why should it?) So, here are a few etiquette tips for anyone considering a honeymoon registry. END
BEGIN HERE   Wedding registry website services such as Wanderable offer the option of having the registered couple "pick up" the fees associated with their service, rather than the guest having to pay. This way, your guests are truly gifting you the amount they desire to, and you will be charged the small percentage/fee when you "cash out." Also popular is Honeyfund, which operates on a "no fee" basis, encouraging gift givers to give the contribution directly to you via cash or check. END

BEGIN HERE   We don't know where you plan on heading for your honeymoon, but we do know once you arrive, there's a category of garments that every bride will need no matter the location — lingerie. While American women tend to think the more elaborate the sexier, our Parisian counterparts think its less about straps and strings and more about showing your gorgeous shape. Curvier woman look stunning in higher waisted, lace-detailed sets, while slimmer straight hips look more alluring in low bikini/string bottoms and low-cut demi bras. Either way forget the fuss and complicated pieces, a simple sultry black lace set will not disappoint. END
BEGIN HERE Hoping to cut costs without missing out on all the wedding action? For most brides, hiring a photographer is a non-negotiable, but many girls regret not bringing a videographer on board, because well, there's just something to be said about watching your big day back on film that simply doesn't compare to those picture perfect still shots. So if the traditional route doesn't float your boat or perhaps it breaks the bank, consider trying one of these five unique alternatives for an unforgettable and budget-friendly wedding video keepsake.

It may come as no surprise considering the guest in question, but when the officiant addresses the crowd, saying, "Speak now or forever hold your peace," there's a solid chance Kanye might pull a 2009 VMA reenactment. I'm gonna let you finish, but... It turns out he almost pulled a similar wedding-stopping stunt before, back when his now-wife Kim Kardashian was set to wed Kris Humphries! END
BEGIN HERE On a recent episode of Kocktails With Khloé, the hostess had both her big sister and her brother-in-law, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, on the show where the latter actually opened up on his wife's infamously short-lived marriage to Atlanta Hawks basketball player, Kris Humphries. And from the sound of it, West seemed none too pleased with the match-up back in the day. Guess he knew that he was meant to be with Kim K all along! END
BEGIN HERE Before Saint West, North West, and one epic European wedding extravaganza could all come to be, the rapper knew he had to put an end to this whole Humphries foolishness. In order to try to stop to their 2011 "I do's," Kanye went to some great lengths. The situation even lead him to purchasing his first ever cell phone! "I got a phone because somebody decided they wanted to marry Kris Humphries," West hilariously said on the show. "I looked on the Internet, and there was [Kim] with some extremely tall person. I was like I need to call her or something." END
BEGIN HERE The man had a strategy. He began texting Kim certain photos (the totally suitable-for-work kind) that he thought that would dissuade her from tying the knot. "I started sending her pictures of certain basketball players that used to be cool and that now they wear their pants all the way up to here," West said, gesturing to his chest. "Like, 'This is your future!'" END
BEGIN HERE  I Object! Real Brides on the Guests Who Tried to Stop Their Weddings END
BEGIN HERE Although Kim did end up marrying Humphries, something West had said must have stuck with the reality star because, 72 days later, she was back on the market and now five years later, her and Kanye are still going strong — with two adorable kids, no less!

BEGIN HERE "Some toys and products add sensations that the human body doesn't evoke during even creative sex," explains Carol Queen, Ph.D., sexologist and author of The Sex & Pleasure Book: Good Vibrations Guide to Great Sex for Everyone. But you don't need a bedside drawer brimming with sex toys. In fact, our experts says, there are just four things you need to get stocked, stat. END
BEGIN HERE   If you only keep one toy in your bedside drawer, this should be it. "There are nerve endings whose job it is to recognize vibration," Queen explains. "It's a sensation that many people love, and vibration can support and enhance orgasm even among people who aren't easily orgasmic in other ways." With hundreds of battery-operated vibrators to choose from, Queen recommends selecting a model "that is slender enough to fit between two bodies lets you use it clitorally during intercourse, and that can maximize the chances that you will climax during the deed."

BEGIN HERE It feels like the skies should open to Purple Rain today with the sad, sad news that the world lost one of its most legendary musicians. Prince — originally Prince Rogers Nelson — passed away earlier today at the age of 57, according to TMZ. The larger-than-life musician has been churning out Hall of Fame-worthy records since 1978, with the debut of his first album titled, For You. And since then he has sold 100 million records, won a total of seven Grammy Awards, and was deemed by Rolling Stone to be one of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Not to mention, the man could write one hell of a love song... END
BEGIN HERE "You don't have to be rich to be my girl," the Purple One once sang. "You don't have to be cool to rule my world. Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with, I just want your extra time and your kiss." From "Kiss" to "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World," Prince was, well, the king of swoon-worthy songs. ("Raspberry Beret" is just the tune for a get-everyone-on-the-dance-floor anthem) But just where did the legendary singer get all his inspiration for those songs that made many an '80s teenage girl's heart go all aflutter? Well, from his own epic love life, of course. END

BEGIN HERE Prince penned "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World" for his most famous love, former backup dancer, Mayte Garcia, who would eventually become his first wife. "Prince was my first crush, and my first love," Garcia later explained to the UK's Mirror. The pair had met when Garcia was 16 and Prince was 32, after Garcia landed a role dancing in his "Diamonds and Pearls" 1992 world tour. "I remember our first kiss, and thinking, 'Oh God, oh wow, this is not happening!'" the dancer recalls. "I remember it being overwhelming and weird. Our entire time together was amazing and surreal, and he showed me some incredible things and introduced me to incredible people." END
BEGIN HERE Prince and Garcia wed in a lavish wedding on Valentine's Day, 1996. Garcia donned a pendant around her neck with the star's infamous nominal symbol emblazoned on it, and white doves — to the tune of "When Doves Cry" we hope — were released at the "I dos."

Prince's former bride ended up auctioning off a few mementos from their nuptials earlier this year, according to Vogue. Items included her 2.2 diamond engagement ring and her handwritten marriage proposal from the "Let's Go Crazy" singer, as well their wedding china (adorning with piano keys and the love symbol, of course) and Garcia's lace wedding dress.

The pair wed quietly in 2001, according to People, but had split by 2006. END
BEGIN HERE But despite the sad end to their too-short story, Prince's first love, Garcia, only looks back on those "Purple Rain" days fondly. "All the songs he wrote for me, that's a pretty hard act to follow," she said. "I've dated a couple of guys, musicians, who have written me poems or songs and I'm like, 'Seriously, don't even go there. You can't compete!' END

BEGIN HERE Olympic gold medalist Shawn Johnson and her longtime love, Andrew East, married last weekend in a beautiful Tennessee wedding in front of their closest family and friends. But, when it comes to the even better part of the wedding planning journey (the honeymoon!), they're waiting to head off to paradise. END
BEGIN HERE The reason? East was signed by the Oakland Raiders started a week or two ago, according to E! News, so the following day he had to head off to camp. That's not to say they didn't enjoy a little post-wedding wine tasting mini-moon in the Napa Valley, California, but they are waiting to head off to the "big" honeymoon until their work schedules calm down. The former Chiefs long snapper and his equally-athletic wife's Instagram was filled with fun snaps from their little getaway. As far as the real honeymoon, the newlyweds will be taking a South Caribbean cruise once East can take a few days off. The irony is that Johnson is actually a godmother to one of the Royal Caribbean cruise ships — along with Gloria Estefan, Michelle Kwan, and Daisy Fuentes. How fitting! END
BEGIN HERE The couple's nuptials were held in Nashville, Tennessee in an evening ceremony. The former Dancing With the Stars contestant wore a unique custom gown by Olia Zavozina, a Nashville-based designer. For the rehearsal dinner, she donned a red dress. Planner Sara Fried shared with E! News that the whole weekend was a love-filled, family-friendly event. "Shawn and Andrew are both very close with their families," she shared. "It's important that both the ceremony and reception remain very intimate. Lots of candles, flowers, and touches of gold [created] a romantic setting." END
BEGIN HERE There's no doubt it was a beautiful event, especially since the 24-year-old football player had the most adorable proposal — right in the middle of Wrigley Field — for his fiancé! Congratulations again, lovebirds. END

BEGIN HERE This seems to be the most-winning, most-common status update, because your social media friends can't seem to get enough of the happiness it portrays. Yes, they admit, it smacks of bragging. But there's just enough sincerity that they can still stand it. "You're probably not the happiest woman in the world," says Bethany, "but it's really fun to read that you're feeling like it. This makes me so very happy for you."

BEGIN HERE While "friend-ors" (friends as wedding vendors) aren't always the best choice for your wedding (after all, why would you want your BFF stuck behind her camera instead of celebrating with you?), there are a few that, if your friend is crazy talented, are worth considering. One of those? A hair or makeup artist. Instead of missing your party, he or she is there with you before the madness begins, and gets to play a role in turning you into a bride. What's not to love?! But some super-talented friends might insist that you accept their services as a wedding gift — so thoughtful, but you've got to repay them somehow! Our experts have rounded up a few ways to thank a friend who is donating their services. END
BEGIN HERE It all starts with a note. Whether it's on personal stationery or in a sweet card, a handwritten note to thank your friend for both offering his or her services and making you feel so special on your wedding day should be included, no matter how else you choose to thank them. END
BEGIN HERE If you're doing a hair or makeup trial before the wedding, take your friend out for a meal or a drink once you're done (and to show off your new look!). Sure, you can chat a little bit about what you do and don't love — this is a great time to test that long-wear lipstick! — but be sure to jump from "bride" mode back into "friend" mode quickly! END
BEGIN HERE On your wedding day, consider giving your friend a gift to thank them for all of their help and hard work. Be sure to pick out something really personal that you know they'll love (not something that matches the bridesmaids' gifts!), whether it's an accessory, a piece of jewelry, a gift certificate to their favorite spa, or another item they've been eyeing. Things to avoid? Gift certificates for products related to their profession. Sure, a makeup artist could always use new brushes or the hottest new blush, but this gift should be something for them to use themselves, not as part of their business. Wrap it beautifully, tuck in that card, and you're good to go! END

BEGIN HERE "So, 9 years ago I asked Courtney if she was a Britney fan as I had heard there was an impromptu show at the House of Blues," Courtney's new fiancé told Britney-Galaxy.com. "She said she was, so away we went. Prior to the show I was approached by a couple people asking if I wanted to be a part of the show. I said yes and was escorted backstage but Courtney wasn't allowed to come with. I was brought up during the show and Britney gave me a lap dance (and basically solidified mine and Courtney's relationship!). END
BEGIN HERE "Fast forward 9 years later to when I had worked on a proposal for about 18 months. I used every contact I had to try and reach Britney's camp and sure enough the last one worked. My contact reached out to all of Britney's managers and they were on-board and basically said 'This has to happen!' END
BEGIN HERE "When Courtney and I arrived they ushered us past everyone and out to the rest of the meet-and-greet people so fast that Courtney didn't have any time to register what was going on until about 5 minutes prior to meeting Ms. Spears. When we got to the front, she ended up telling Brit that she'd given me a lap dance 9 years ago! Britney smiled and winked at me, and I got down on one knee and said, 'So I'm asking you in front of our friend Britney here. Will you be my wife forever?' END
BEGIN HERE "Courtney started to shake and cry and smile. She stuck her hand out, but kept looking at Britney then back at the ring. Finally I asked again, 'So what do you think? Want me to put it on you or what?!" That's when Britney laughed really hard. Courtney ended up saying yes, so I placed it on her finger as everyone cheered us on. From first date to proposal, 9 years goes by fast. But I'm lucky enough to get to spend everyday with Courtney, and lucky enough that Britney and her staff are some of the kindest people I've ever met." END

Stunning mixes of roses, anemones, blackerries, pieris japonica, and flowing greenery surely offered a reprieve from the winter landscape outdoors. Table numbers were written on stained wooden blocks, while mustard-hued napkins featured custom stained wood napkin rings. END

"We loved seeing all of the details that we had been planning for the past year and three months, all in one place. It was great to be able to take it all in and reflect on what we had been through."

They served a feast of local and seasonal items, including a roasted winter squash medallion, spice rubbed beef tenderloin, citrus rubbed halibut, and Dungeness crab cakes. END
BEGIN HERE While the couple didn't give out favors (Kristina and Joshua made a donation to Bulldog Haven instead), they did serve up glazed doughnuts for their guests to take home in monogrammed bags. "That was really special to us," Kristina says. "We also made a donation to The Paul Lee Foundation, which raises awareness and resources for those struggling with mental or emotional health. Our college experienced a school shooting our senior year and Paul Lee's life was taken." END

BEGIN HERE Roses are red, violets are blue, there are so many options when it comes to wedding flowers, what's a bride to do? You may have one or two favorites but making sure your selections actually match your wedding is essential. So we chatted with Bronwen Smith, Owner and Lead Designer of B Floral for tips and tricks. Here's what she recommends for some of the biggest venue categories. END

BEGIN HERE  A Glossary of Wedding Flowers by Color END
BEGIN HERE If your reception venue is substantially different than your ceremony, it's probably best to keep the flowers in harmony with the site. "You can use similar elements in each venue, but ultimately have your blooms speak to the specific venue," Smith says. "Use at least one flower variety that can continue from ceremony to reception... Classic florals such as roses or orchids are versatile varieties that will flow seamlessly between two differing spaces." END
BEGIN HERE That all being said, don't ask for so many opinions when it comes to coordinating florals, or you risk there being "too many cooks in the kitchen" that may make your arrangements misguided. And remember that some guests bring beautiful centerpieces home. Take it as a compliment, but don't use pricey vases that you'll never see again. END
BEGIN HERE This is it... The final countdown to your big day. And along with settling those last few details — figuring out where to seat your eccentric Uncle Carl, firming up the flowers, deciding on your first dance song — you're likely also making one last push to make sure the body that will be wearing that gorgeous white gown looks as good as it possibly can. You and nearly every other woman with an engagement ring on her finger. In fact, research shows that an overwhelming 91 percent of brides-to-be are anxious about their weight.

BEGIN HERE Delphine Manivet's Spring 2017 presentation was held at Ladurée quite fitting for the quintessential French bridal designer. Also fitting were the nonchalant chignons that were paired with soft, romantic dresses — the epitome of French-girl chic. "It's a pretty hairstyle but it's not too 'done,'" says hairstylist Fabric Gili, who created the look. Here, he tells us how he did it. END
BEGIN HERE 1. Center part your hair and apply a dime-sized amount of a texture cream from root to tip. (He used Fekkai Blowout Texturizer.) Then rough dry hair with a blow dryer. END
BEGIN HERE 2. Spritz a beach spray, like Verb Sea Spray, all over hair. If you still need a bit more texture, curl random sections with a one-inch barrel curling iron. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Courtesy of Delphine Manivet    END
BEGIN HERE 3. Loop hair into a loose chignon at the nape of the neck and secure with a clear elastic, keeping out few pieces of face-framing strands. Make sure your hair covers your earsâ€¢a key element to making it look soft and natural, Gili says. Finish with a light coat of hairspray. He used Fekkai Sheer Hold Hairspray; we also like Sachajuan Light & Flexible Hairspray. END
BEGIN HERE Sometime in the past few years, the photo of the bridal party wearing matching robes became as coveted as the shot of the just-wed couple in front of the city skyline. Paired with mimosas, matching robes set the festivities off on a high note and make the bridal party look oh-so-chic from the very beginning. Not to mention, giving your best ladies a robe serves as a token of your appreciation for them standing by your side on your big day. Check out our favorite spots to find getting-ready robes in Chicago. END

Whatever you're looking for, Nordstrom is bound to have it.

BEGIN HERE Michael Phelps won his 19th Olympic gold medal on Sunday, after competing in the 4x100 men's relay competition in the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. Was it because of the months spent training or his past (and mighty successful we might add!) Olympics history? Nope! (Although that probably did have something to do with it...) In our opinion, Phelps' gold medal victory was thanks to his two number one fans: His fiancé Nicole Johnson and baby son Boomer — a.k.a the cutest cheering section in all of Rio de Janeiro. END
BEGIN HERE "One of the coolest things about being a father going into Rio is that our firstborn has the chance to see my last race ever," Phelps previously told Us Weekly ahead of the 2016 Olympic games. "I think that's something that'll be really special, that we'll be able to share stories with him... and I'm excited to have a lot of photos and just to share the moments and memories with him growing up as a kid." And his sweetheart and three-month-old baby boy really did win the gold in making Phelps' final few swims (this is the champion swimmer's final Olympics before retiring) special — just as a super cute fan club ought to do! Before the games even started, Johnson and Boomer were proudly representing Team USA all over the 'gram. END

BEGIN HERE The new mom Instagrammed a few insanely adorable photos (see below) of her little one rocking an Olympics onesie and snuggled up in a Team USA blanket. The proud parents even had teeny tiny red, white, and blue sneakers made, emblazoned with Boomer's name. Johnson showed off the patriotic kicks and her on-theme mani while she was it, but it was the bling on her ring finger that caught our eye. That certainly isn't the huge engagement ring she was previously rocking. It looks awfully like a gold wedding band, does it not? Johnson did tag the photo with the hashtags "nodiamondsinrio" and "replacementring" so this could be a totally innocent ring switch-a-roo while she travels abroad. But we've still gotta ask... Anyone else think a secret wedding is underfoot? END
BEGIN HERE But whether she's still a bride-to-be or currently toting wifey status, Johnson let the world know just how much she loves her beau as she and baby Boomer lead Phelps' cheering section as he won his 19th gold medal. Swaddled in a red and white carrier covered in stars and his daddy's initials and wearing a pair of patriotic noise-blocking headphones (gotta protect those cute little ears), Boomer cozied up to mom as dad conquered the race. After Phelps snagged the gold, he presented Johnson a bouquet of flowers and a stuffed animal for their little one. "The moment when I got to see my amazing family in the stands," Phelps captioned a social media photo of when he first emerged from the pool. END

BEGIN HERE All the details are falling into place and so far they're sounding Pitch Perfect to us! Anna Camp, star of everyone's favorite musical/comedy Pitch Perfect, is in the final countdown till her wedding to co-star Skylar Astin. The wedding venue is booked, Camp's beauty trial is done (and she looked gorgeous, we might add!), the wedding flowers are in bloom, and heck, the couple has already bought themselves a newlywed nest! The latest big day detail to come together? The bride's wedding dress! Camp just revealed that she has officially found her dream gown. (As if we needed another reason to get pumped for this aca-awesome wedding day!) END
BEGIN HERE We've been looking forward to the wedding between these two crooning co-stars since Astin popped the question with a champagne-hued cushion-cut diamond ring while he and his bride-to-be were on vacation during New Year's Eve. "He asked. I said YES!!!!" Camp captioned her engagement ring selfie, revealing her lovely new sparkler. Since then, the actress has been busying herself planning their big day. "We're thinking different shades of pinks and peach, and also a lot of ivory and greenery," mused Camp of her wedding day vibe at a California outdoor venue. "I want the colors to feel very nature-friendly, but very vibrant and lively... I want it to feel like you are walking into Romeo and Juliet's beautiful fantasy." Again, we gotta say it: This sounds aca-awesome! "There might be some people there who are our loving friends who we know from Pitch Perfect," Camp also teased of her guest list. Eeek! Now about that her dream dress... END
BEGIN HERE During a press event, Camp revealed that she has officially found her dream dress. That's reason enough for an impromptu acapella song, no? According to Entertainment Tonight, the blonde beauty describes her wedding gown as "gorgeous" and we couldn't be more excited to see her rock it down the aisle. If it's anything like the bridal white frock she wore for her engagement photos (see below), Camp is bound to be one beautiful bride! END

BEGIN HERE We like to think our besties will make the perfect bridesmaids. But as these brides reveal, they can seriously get on your nerves. Here, they share their biggest pet peeves from their bridesmaids on or around the big day. END
BEGIN HERE "I asked all of my nine bridesmaids to wear silver shoes and one of them showed up in black. I know, I know, not earth-shattering, but I was still kind of annoyed since they wore short dresses and her shoes stuck out in photos. I've always wondered if she forgot or just decided the heck with it. I'm like most women and am super passive-aggressive, so I'm sure I'll never have the guts to ask." — Jeannie END
BEGIN HERE "Taking on the posture that it is your wedding and not of mine. It is one thing to be supportive, share tips, and opinions. But it is a whole different ball game to attempt to take over. I am all on board for hearing and taking advice, but don't be so overbearing to the point where you make the person feel like it's not just a suggestion but a mandate or command. It's only one big day and it's mine, so stand by my side, not in front of me. And when it's your time, I'll do the same." — Chantay END
BEGIN HERE "I'm recently married, and I would say my biggest pet peeve is bridesmaids who don't realize their role in helping you plan the big day. We're so excited you will be standing next to us on our big day, but we're not just asking you to put on a dress and show up at the wedding. Planning the big day takes an army, and part of being a bridesmaid is being a part of the planning committee. There are so many elements that go into the big day, and trust me, your bride would really appreciate if you offer to help and roll your sleeves up. Planning a wedding is a lot of work and super stressful. That's why she needs your support in the days leading up to the wedding." — Diana END
BEGIN HERE "My biggest pet peeve was with my sister-in-law complaining about paying for her bridesmaid's dress. Part of the problem was that the dress was multi-colored, which was symbolic for both the groom and me but which also meant she was unlikely to ever wear the dress again. Another part of the problem was we had only met once, and she was a newlywed and recent college graduate, so money was tight for her. I think we paid for her dress or offered to. We finally have a functioning relationship, but it has taken a very long time." — Ruth END

END
BEGIN HERE "My engagement ring is in a safety deposit box," Kunis told the radio show, "I can't wear this because someone's going to chop my hand off for it." END
BEGIN HERE Mila Kunis Engagement Ring END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Getty Images    END
BEGIN HERE To make matters even more confusing, she went on to say that the couple decided on cheaper wedding bands because she didn't want them to take away from the "incredibly beautiful engagement ring" Kutcher picked out for her. END
BEGIN HERE "I decided our wedding bands were going to be wonderful and beautiful and simple, and so we got them made on Etsy," Kunis said. The couple opted to buy their bands from Etsy because the thin platinum bands that they were looking to purchase were so expensive everywhere else. END
BEGIN HERE "Mine is 1mm platinum and his is 2mm yellow gold and made by a wonderful little old lady," Kunis said of the bands. END
BEGIN HERE While we absolutely agree that sometimes the perfect companion to a stunning engagement ring is a simple wedding band, and hers is undeniably gorgeous, wouldn't her reasoning for getting the simple bands be voided when she decided to stop wearing her engagement ring? END
BEGIN HERE Regardless, the thin platinum wedding band looks stunning on her and we have no doubt that this subtle, low key look will grow into a wedding ring mega trend inspired by Kunis. But will it beat out the world's love of giant, flashy diamonds? Only time will tell! END
BEGIN HERE  Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher Were Just Caught in a Too-Cute PDA Moment END
BEGIN HERE While it's always nice to be able to offer your guests a choice of entrées at your reception, finding out what they'd like to eat is an extra detail you need to keep track of as RSVPs roll in. Offering a kids' meal can complicate things even further: The option isn't usually included on RSVP cards, which means you'll need to get in touch with any guests with children directly to figure out whether their kids will want a children's or adult's meal. And then there's the cost! That filet is definitely pricier than chicken fingers, and it can be hard to accept that your cousin's seven-year-old will enjoy (or finish!) the fancier dish. So are brides and grooms allowed to decide all kids get the kids' meal, no matter what? Our experts weigh in. END
BEGIN HERE Whether it's a matter of cost or merely simplicity, a couple can definitely decide that all kids get a kids' meal instead of serving them adult options. However, the detail you'll have to address is what makes someone qualify as a "kid." A safe bet is to say that any guests under age 12 receive kids' meals, while teens will get adult meals. Think of it as the wedding reception equivalent of sitting at the kids' table or the adult's table at Thanksgiving! END
BEGIN HERE Do you have guests whose two children flank that age cut-off (say, an 11- and 14-year-old)? In this case, you may want to ask the parents. Let them know that you will be serving kids' meals to all guests under 12, and that you want to confirm if their older child would prefer a kids' meal as well. END
BEGIN HERE You will also want to make sure you find out about any and all allergies the children at your wedding might have. While adults are well-versed in confirming whether a dish contains an ingredient they're allergic to, kids haven't had quite as much practice, and their parents will appreciate the extra precaution. END
BEGIN HERE  Can I Bring My Son or Daughter as My Plus-One? END
BEGIN HERE It's incredibly popular to have a friend or family member perform the wedding ceremony. We can credit Joey from NBC's hit Friends for teaching all of America how to get ordained online when he married Monica and Chandler in 2001. That was really the first time most people realized you could be married by somebody other than a real religious person, judge, or Justice of the Peace. END
BEGIN HERE Since then, there has been an explosion of quasi-religious organizations hawking online ordinations, and providing the necessary paperwork for anyone to legally perform weddings. In some places, the officiant needs to register with the state, county, or municipality, but as a general rule, the entire process isn't difficult or expensive. In fact, it's frequently less expensive than hiring a local minister. END
BEGIN HERE We've seen lots of brides and grooms married by friends over the years, and most of the time the ceremony is very personal and touching. Unfortunately, the most memorable wedding ceremonies have been conducted by well-meaning "officiants" who have never performed an actual wedding ceremony before, and essentially have no idea what they're doing. So it make sure your wedding ceremony is the best it can be, follow these five tips if you're using a friend as your wedding officiant. END

BEGIN HERE Christine Agnello and Scott Ellis first met through mutual friends in September of 2010, but it took seven months for the pair to officially become a couple. Three years later, Scott popped the question on the rooftop of the house that he and Christine share. Once she said "Yes!" the future Mr. and Mrs. began planning their dream day in Philadelphia, leaning largely on their own expertise and the team of vendors they had in place. "I didn't have a wedding planner at all, so I took on all of the planning and coordinating myself," Christine says. "It was stressful because I wasn't sure if my vision would come together, but all of my vendors exceeded my expectations!" END
BEGIN HERE With the Fairmount Park Horticulture Center locked in as their venue, Christine and Scott invited 150 guests to join them for a colorful fall wedding on October 10, 2015. "We loved the rustic feel of getting married in a greenhouse and that we had the option have the ceremony outdoors if the weather was warm," the bride says. Their day went off without a hitch, and thanks to Lauren Fair Photography, we can take a look inside this adorable duo's poppy-hued party! END

BEGIN HERE Christine admits she never had a "magical" dress shopping moment during which she knew she had found her gown. "I just kept going back to the store and trying on the same dress over and over again until one of my best friends said, 'If you've tried it on this many times, I think this is the dress,'" the bride says. The off-white lace style featured an open back and fit Christine like a glove. Although she was meant to complete her look with a pair of blue pumps, she made a last minute decision to wear a pair of comfortable Toms instead. "The heels were sinking into the mud during photos, so I switched to my blue Toms and wore the whole night!" END
BEGIN HERE Her final touch was a bright bouquet of dahlias, succulents, billy balls, and eucalyptus, as well as an all-white flower crown — the latter of which almost didn't make it to the wedding. One of Scott's groomsmen was tasked with picking up the wedding flowers, driving the bouquets to the ladies, and then bringing the boutonnieres back to the guys. While the bouquets arrived without trouble, it wasn't until the groom's attendant made it back to the hotel that the bride realized her flower crown hadn't been delivered. "He didn't have enough time to come back so he sent it with an Uber driver instead," Christine says. But the drama didn't end there. "The driver couldn't find out house, so he actually just handed the bag with the flower crown to a random person walking on the street. That person just so happened to be my photographer, so it all worked out, but that was stressful." END

"I love the mismatched look, so I gave them a range of blue and green colors as options and let them all find their own dresses," the bride says. "It was just a coincidence that everyone ended up wearing full-length dresses. I was so happy with how it all came together!" END

BEGIN HERE This is it... The final countdown to your big day. And along with settling those last few details — figuring out where to seat your eccentric Uncle Carl, firming up the flowers, deciding on your first dance song — you're likely also making one last push to make sure the body that will be wearing that gorgeous white gown looks as good as it possibly can. You and nearly every other woman with an engagement ring on her finger. In fact, research shows that an overwhelming 91 percent of brides-to-be are anxious about their weight. But from here on out, you won't have to be!  END
BEGIN HERE Whether you want to drop those last few pounds or look more toned — or both — we've got a month's worth of daily tips (none of which require starving yourself or working out nonstop!) that will help you feel stunning and confident when you walk down that aisle. You know where to send the thank-you card. Let's get started! END
BEGIN HERE Whether you're a girlfriend, fianceé, or wife, one thing is for sure — it's pretty hard for your man to get anything past you without you first catching onto his sneaky little plan (let's be real, how many of you suspected his proposal?!). Which is exactly why we're giving groom Hunter Heinrich a standing ovation for secretly planning one of the most epic wedding dances we've ever seen, just so he could surprise his new wife in front of their closest family and friends — and go on to be a viral internet sensation, of course. END
BEGIN HERE The video, which was shared on Facebook on Tuesday, has already racked up more than 5.5 million views. Yup, it's THAT incredible. Heinrich and his groomsmen get down (and we mean down) to some of our favorite hits like "Forever" by Chris Brown, "Bootylicious" by Destiny's Child, and "Marry You" by Bruno Mars, all of which include a lot of booty shaking. Hey, we're not complaining! END
BEGIN HERE But what may be the cutest aspect of the viral video is watching the bride's reaction to witnessing what we imagine is one of the biggest surprises of her life. As she sits there in shock, Heinrich does whatever he can to make her laugh as he shakes his butt with his groomsmen and shows off his best Carlton-inspired dance moves. END
BEGIN HERE The photographer who captured it all, Miranda Marrs, told the Huffington Post, "The whole room — guests, family, even the other vendors — were laughing so hard and so much, I was afraid at some points that maybe you wouldn't be able to hear the music clearly! It was so hard for me to keep my composure and not have the camera shaking from holding in my own laughter!" END
BEGIN HERE This groom definitely just set the bar high for wedding dance routines. Congrats on your marriage you two, and here's to hoping there's lots of laughter and dancing in the years to come! END

BEGIN HERE Some brides get lucky and choose a wedding venue that provides onsite catering. Other brides need to add caterers to the vendor list — and the hunt can get tricky. From picking a company before trying their food to making sure the service is top notch, the caterer can be the most overwhelming hire on your wedding to-do list. And it should be — food and drink will most likely be the largest portion of your wedding budget. So if you're struggling to figure out exactly how to feed your guests, consider these tips for finding a wedding caterer that's right for you. END
BEGIN HERE   Sign the contract after creating a finalized proposal, which outlines the total cost of your food and drink, including the menu, the catering staff, linens and party rentals, and any additional fees. Set up a time for a tasting of your full menu. Pro tip: If you changed your mind about a menu item, replace it before your actual tasting. You should be trying all of the food you expect to see at the wedding then and may not have another chance to try swaps after your final tasting. END
BEGIN HERE And the rest is easy: Bon appetite! END
BEGIN HERE A ballooning guest list is a challenge nearly every couple deals with during the wedding planning process. Some opt to seek out a venue with a larger capacity, while others get serious about who does and doesn't make the cut (buh-bye, plus-ones!). Whatever you choose, making sure your headcount fits in your venue is important for both your guests' comfort and their safety — going over the maximum capacity can be a fire hazard, and at a minimum could get your event shut down by the fire marshall. So what happens if that magical 15-20% wedding guest decline rate is a myth, and nearly all of your wedding guests are planning to attend? Our experts have a few tips. END
BEGIN HERE First things first: As you're making your guest list (before you send out invitations!), begin to guess which guests will and won't attend. You may know most of your college friends will make the trip, but what about your great-uncle? Marking down whether you anticipate a "yes" or "no" reply will help give you an idea of how many guests to expect so you can feel more confident in choosing your venue — or know if you need to move some guests to the B-list. END
BEGIN HERE As RSVPs come in, if you see that "yes" number creeping higher and higher, get in touch with your venue. Can you change your space rental from a half ballroom to a full ballroom, or open up the doors to put some of the dinner tables on the porch? What about having dinner in one room and dancing in another? Figure out if there is a way to be flexible with seating so your guests will all fit. If the space simply doesn't get any bigger, but you're still below the maximum capacity, you could also have all the dinner tables set up and then move or break-down a few tables to create a dance floor later in the evening. Have you blown past your venue's maximum capacity? Unless there's a creative alternative to fit everyone, you're stuck finding a new venue, as most won't try to be flexible — their liability and insurance is at stake! END
BEGIN HERE If your guest list still fits comfortably, but the issue is budget, talk to your vendors about how to stretch things a little further. Would serving a buffet instead of a plated dinner cut the costs? What about offering less-expensive hors d'oeuvres or swapping the open bar for beer and wine only? And when it comes to flowers, ask your florist which blooms will keep your total down, as well as which décor items you can skip or reuse in multiple locations throughout the night. Get creative with ways to stretch your dollar, then smile because so many people want to celebrate with you! END

BEGIN HERE If you're a bride who's close to her pops, you probably couldn't imagine not having your father walk you down the aisle on the big day. Not only is it tradition, but it's a monumental milestone that's bound to stir up a bevy of emotions in both of you and your dear old dad. And us, as well! That father/daughter walk down the aisle pretty much always has us reaching for the tissues! But there aren't enough Kleenex in the world to catch our tears while watching this Pennsylvania bride make her grand entrance. Although Jeni Stepien's father was unable to physically walk her down the aisle after his tragic death, he still did so in spirit — as Stepien was escorted down the aisle by the man who received her father's donated heart. We're not crying, you're crying... END
BEGIN HERE In September 2006, Stepien's father was shot and killed after a robbery attempt, and his family had his organs donated. His heart went to a New Jersey man named Arthur Thomas, who had been diagnosed with ventricular tachycardia 16 years before and was in congestive heart failure when his transplant came through. "He was going to die if he did not receive a new heart in the next several days," the bride explained to The Huffington Post. END
BEGIN HERE Thomas survived thanks to the Stepien family, and stayed in touch with them via letters and phone calls. Almost a decade later, Stepien was engaged. "When my fiancé proposed, one of the first things I thought of was 'But who will walk me down the aisle?' I could think of nobody more meaningful than Tom," she said. "My fiancé suggested I write him a letter. That way Tom would feel in no way obligated or pressured by my request." END

BEGIN HERE You probably finalized your wedding guest list long ago, but not everyone is going to make the cut for the pre-nuptial events — and that includes the bridal shower. According to the Emily Post Institute, "A shower should be an intimate party — not a gathering that rivals the wedding — so the guest list is usually made up of the couple's close friends, family, and attendants." That being said, narrowing down your guest list to the select few can be tricky. While it's up to the host to decide on the number of guests, consider these factors before turning your list over to her. END
BEGIN HERE  Bridal Shower Etiquette 101: Everything You Need to Know About Your Pre-Wedding Party END
BEGIN HERE Planning a wedding is all about making decisions: Should we through a causal backyard bash or black-tie ballroom affair? Plated dinner or a free-for-all buffet? Fondant cake or macaroon tower? Mini-moon now or honeymoon later? But one of the biggest decisions you may make is whether to change your last name — and when that question is posed to same-sex couples, our expert says, the options can seem endless. END
BEGIN HERE "Same sex couples are the creative pioneers of modern marriage, for all of us," says Mark O'Connell, New York City-based psychotherapist and author of Modern Brides & Modern Grooms: A Guide to Planning Straight, Gay, and Other Nontraditional Twenty-First-Century Weddings. "That lack of formal same-sex marriage traditions means that our options are wide open. And that goes for the surnames we choose to use, too." END
BEGIN HERE After all, O'Connell points out, there's not exactly a name-change tradition that's been set for hundreds of years, as there has been for heterosexual couples, that guides same-sex couples one way or another. "The lack of precedential standards for marriages like ours means that there are no tradition police to tell us whose name to take," he says. END
BEGIN HERE Of course, one obvious option is for both of you to keep both of you respective surnames. "Most modern couples today, gay or straight, value equality and mutual recognition between partners," O'Connell explains. "And the many same-sex couples who choose to keep their own surnames post-wedding, are great symbols of this gender neutral equality within marriage. Many straight couples are following this example, too." END
BEGIN HERE  How to Find the Right Officiant For Your Same-Sex Marriage END
BEGIN HERE But as stated above, that's hardly your only choice. Together, you could decide to take one partner's surname as your own. "Some couples prefer to have one last name for the sake of coherence and for recognition by the rest of the world," O'Connell says. Be prepared for roadblocks if you take this route, O'Connell warns, as you will need to seek court approval to change your given name. END
BEGIN HERE "Currently the only case in which a spouse can take her spouse's surname without a lot of complicated paperwork is when a woman takes her husband's last name," he says. "Every other case — including straight grooms taking the surname of their straight brides — involves court approval, and lots of legal paperwork depending on the state in which you live." END
BEGIN HERE Lastly, you could consider creating a new last name that you both take as your own, and that, should you choose to have them, your children could one day share too. This works, too, if you're intent on keeping a professional name but want a new name for legal and personal matters, O'Connell says. END
BEGIN HERE You might even consider creating a new last name that both you, your spouse, and your children share. Both spouses might consider keeping their professional names exactly as they are and creating a new name for all legal/ personal matters. This could also help to protect privacy for their family, if one or both of the spouses has very public careers. END

BEGIN HERE Bushnell recently revealed that they are just starting the wedding planning process now. "We haven't set a date," Bushnell told Us Weekly. "We definitely started talking about it more, and I think we both agreed that August we actually want to sit down and start planning, so that includes setting a date, that includes the place. We have been throwing around some locations, and I think we've narrowed it down to the area that we want to get married. We're thinking 2017." END
BEGIN HERE Though she may not know what her wedding dress will look like or where they'll exchange vows, Bushnell did say that the couple is hoping to have their wedding filmed, but she didn't specify whether or not fans can expect a television special about the wedding. END
BEGIN HERE "Hopefully we'll have cameras there, so it could, kind of, not only document the fun aspects of it for us later in life, cause we're gonna watch it back, but also for our fans and for Bachelor nation." END
BEGIN HERE We have trouble believing that Bushnell and Higgins' nuptials won't end up on television, especially since they are currently being followed by cameras as we speak.

BEGIN HERE In a rather revealing/hilarious Instagram pic (see below), the mom- and bride-to-be showcased the rather voluptuous side effects of being preggo: BOOBIES! She wrote, "Hi boobs [wide-eye emojis]. My lawd this milk thing is no joke #DoubleDs." We're pretty certain her hubby-to-be doesn't have any objections to that! Murgatroyd has also been showing off her insanely cute baby bump for her Instagram followers, whether it be by baring that bump-ity cuteness in a tight crop top or in a more comfy, loose-fitting dress. END
BEGIN HERE After pregnancy rumors surrounding Murgatroyd and Chmerkovskiy were swirling around the Internet for about a month back in June, the couple excitedly announced the addition of a new (and dare we say future DWTS) family member. But it wasn't easy for Murgatroyd the first few months of pregnancy. She revealed to People, "I was so sick." Despite her morning sickness though, the Australian dancer seemed more than excited to welcome a new baby into the world. "I'm looking forward to nurturing something and just having the baby be the center of our world," she told People. "I'm looking forward to putting all our energy into this beautiful soul." END

BEGIN HERE Color us excited because plans for Britain's next nearly-royal wedding are officially underway and the big day is slated for May 2017. Mark your calendars! Cancel all your plans! And get ready to check yes on that RSVP card for Pippa Middleton's wedding. The sister of the Duchess of Cambridge is currently figuring out the big day details of her wedding to fiancé James Matthews and we have all the deets — including how the bride's royal sis won't be a bridesmaid in the ceremony. Wait, what?! END
BEGIN HERE This past summer, Middleton's longtime love, financier James Matthews, popped the question with a vintage-inspired three-carat engagement ring featuring an octagonal-shaped halo. "Miss Pippa Middleton and Mr. James Matthews are delighted to announce that they became engaged on Sunday, July 17, and plan to marry next year," the couple said in a short joint statement. And now comes the newest royal revelation that the couple is planning to tie the knot less than a year after that ring was slipped on Middleton's finger. END
BEGIN HERE According to Vogue, Middleton will be walking down the aisle at St. Mark's, her local church in Englefield, Berkshire. And after the "I dos," the newlyweds' 150 guests will retreat to the backyard garden of the bride's parents for sweet, at-home wedding reception. We're counting down the days as we speak! END
BEGIN HERE   But back to that ceremony... Apparently, the Duchess of Cambridge isn't planning on standing by her sister's side as a bridesmaid when she says her vows. In case you've forgotten (and if so, shame on you!), Middleton wowed the world when she was a bridesmaid at the Royal Wedding between the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William back in 2011. Sure, she wasn't the star of the show and spent the day holding and fluffing the bride-to-be's long train, but didn't Middleton look fabulous in her Sarah Burton for Alexandra McQueen white sheath while doing so? But it sounds like her sister won't be repaying the favor... END
BEGIN HERE  Prince Harry's New Girlfriend Is Giving Us Serious Hopes for Another Royal Wedding END
BEGIN HERE According to Vogue, royal experts are speculating that having the future Queen of England walk down the aisle would cause a bit of spectacle, so the Duchess is reportedly opting to take a backseat at Middleton's upcoming "I dos." But that doesn't mean that this wedding party will be totally devoid of royalty. Rumor has it that Prince Willam and the Duchess' little ones, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, will be taking on pageboy and flower girl duties at their aunt's nuptials. And they were worried about the Duchess stealing the show??!! END
BEGIN HERE Some things are just more important than others, that's a fact of life. But while you and your soon-to-be spouse are feeling the stress and pressure of planning your wedding, it's perfectly OK to reevaluate what can be put on hold or take a backseat to the planning process. Doing so will help ensure you are fully present, and may even thoroughly enjoy the process of planning your wedding! END
BEGIN HERE   While deep into the final stages of wedding planning, you may begin to feel as though you're losing control of the details, or even the bigger picture. In an effort to regain control of some aspects of your life it may be tempting to seek out things you can control, or look for a big change. We recommend trying to avoid making any huge or impulsive decisions such as a job change, or relocation while wedding planning. After all, having too many things to focus on and work on can be uber overwhelming. The stress is temporary, but the payoff will be huge (promise!). Once your wedding day has gone off without a hitch, you can reevaluate and see if you really still want to change jobs or move into a new nest. END
BEGIN HERE The best way to get guests to your wedding? Send them an invitation, of course! If you're having an intimate or impromptu wedding, though, it might seem like a formality that's not totally necessary. We asked our experts if you need to send out invitations if you're having a tiny wedding, like a trip to city hall or an elopement. Here's what they had to say. END
BEGIN HERE Even if you're opting for something small or spur-of-the-moment, sending a wedding invitation to anyone you'd like to have there with you is a tradition that's worth including — just with your own spin. Here are a few ways to make the inviting process your own: END
BEGIN HERE For a City Hall wedding (or one in your living room!) with a tiny guest list, skip formal letterpress invitations and traditional wording. Instead, write a letter! Practice your penmanship and pick up some nicer paper, then write a letter to your guests (either a general note so you can send the same one to each guest, or personalized letters to each guest individually) inviting them to share the moment with you and letting them know why their presence would be so meaningful. Got a little extra time (or not-so-nice handwriting)? Hire a calligrapher to copy down your words in beautiful, flowing script. You can pop these in the mail if you have time, or hand-deliver each note if everyone is local. END
BEGIN HERE Eloping last minute? We love the immediacy of a pretty evite. It's more elegant than a text or an email, and adds a little bit of formality to the occasion. Having a celebration that is non-traditional doesn't mean you have to forgo all tradition! If time is really of the essence, you could also set aside some time to call each of the guests you'd like to invite and let them know when and where to meet. Again, skip the text or email and opt for a phone call: It's much more personal and intimate, especially given the reason you're calling! END

BEGIN HERE When you get married on Halloween, it's usually 'go big or go home' when it comes to theme: costumes, spooky decor, — the works. And to prove our point, television journalist Nieves Zuberbuhler and Argentinian socialite Julio Santo Domingo III got married in Brooklyn this weekend and threw a totally fabulous Halloween party-meets-wedding celebration. END
BEGIN HERE The bride, an Emmy-winning producer for CBS' 60 Minutes and her groom created an enchanted-garden-meets-"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" wonderland at the Pioneer Works art gallery in Brooklyn, per Page Six, over Halloween weekend. Their lavish, spirited nuptials (or should we say Monster Mash?) were equally matched by an opulent guest list; Princess Caroline of Monaco, Julia and Vladimir Reston Roitfeld, and Nacho Figueras were among those to attend. END
BEGIN HERE Even though the crowd was dressed in over-the-top costumes all around (from unicorns to police officers to skeletons to ravens), the bride opted for a stunning off-the-shoulder white wedding dress by Brandon Maxwell while the groom rocked a traditional musketeer outfit (yes, with a sword and neckpiece to boot!). END
BEGIN HERE "Brandon Maxwell is my favorite designer," the bride shared with Vogue about her wedding dress, which took a total of nine fittings that lasted several hours each. "He's also a talented stylist and photographer, so he planned every single detail of my wedding day — my dress, my hair, my jewelry, and my makeup. It was a treat to share this moment in my life with him," she explained. END
BEGIN HERE So why didn't this Hallow's Eve-loving bride wear a costume even though she encouraged all of her guests to do so? Simple. "If I had walked down the aisle wearing a costume, I would have regretted it forever. I wanted something romantic, inspired by Pre-Raphaelite art," Zuberbuhler said about her nuptials, which took place at the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary Parish in Red Hook, Brooklyn. After the vow exchange, however, she slipped into light-up sneaks and a short white dress (which was actually her dress — CHOPPED short so that she could still be wearing it throughout the night!) to be more comfortable while rocking it on the dance floor at the reception. END
BEGIN HERE "We cut it twice!" said Maxwell about his dress creation, noting that after the ceremony, they made some major scissored cuts. "We added shoulder straps and chopped off the train and sleeves. And then, at around 1:00 a.m., we made it into a minidress so she could wear her light-up shoes!" Now that is quite the commitment to wearing a wedding dress while still staying true to your own style. END
BEGIN HERE  Halloween Wedding Ideas That Are Anything But Lame END
BEGIN HERE As far as decor, the dark purple lighting added to the eery ambience — complete with a flower wall, "full moon" lighting for a photo op, and a creepy crawly dessert bar and cake situation. To entertain the crowds, the band Oompa Loompa performed. It was truly a spectacular, over-the-top celebration that will definitely go down as one of the most dramatic and entertaining Halloween weddings in recent history. See below for more photos of the epic celebration! END
BEGIN HERE Time to pack up and go home everyone, because it looks like the Tatums just won Halloween. By now, you might have guessed that we're little obsessed with the dynamic duo of Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan Tatum. (Okay, maybe more than a little...) Every time these two publicly declare their eternal affection for one another, post a sweet social media shoutout to their love, or just step foot out of their house looking just so gosh darn adorable together, we can't help but ooh and aah over this celebrity couple.

BEGIN HERE It's looking like the queen of love songs may be hearing wedding bells in the near future! The "Send My Love" singer has been getting super serious with boyfriend Simon Konecki ever since he made a beautiful, grand gesture on their anniversary this year while she was on tour. He surprised the Brit onstage with thousands of hand-written notes in the form of confetti, making for one romantic AF love story. Honestly, you just need to see the heartwarming photos yourself. END
BEGIN HERE And if that's not enough to make your heart skip a beat, a source is now telling the Mirror that the pair is (maybe) headed down the aisle! The source, who identifies as a "friend" of the couple, revealed to the news site this weekend, "They've decided it's the right time to think about making that step. They won't make a big song and dance about it. That's not the way either of them are, and you won't see Adele walking around with a huge diamond on her finger flaunting it. But they're ready to take the next step and both [are] very excited about the prospect. Adele has had an amazing time on tour and is enjoying performing to fans — but she's looking forward to spending some quiet time at home with her family after ten months on the road." END
BEGIN HERE The couple, who already have a three-year-old son, Angelo James Konecki, together, are also hoping to add a new member to their family as soon as possible. After Konecki's very public display of affection on their anniversary this year, the Grammy-award winner revealed to her audience that her and her beau are planning on trying for baby number two. If that's not a step in the marriage direction, then we don't know what is! END
BEGIN HERE  Adele or Bridesmaid? This Maid of Honor's Wedding Speech Parody of 'Hello' is Hysterical END
BEGIN HERE While Adele hasn't confirmed these engagement rumors herself, we can't help but imagine what she'd wear on her big day. Would she wear a traditional white dress, or something more out-of-the-ordinary like a black gown? Looking at her Instagram feed, we're leaning towards the latter. END
BEGIN HERE Helping a friend with a few pre-wedding tasks paid off big for Rebecca Orazi. In October of 2011, Rebecca offered to assist with a DIY project for a friend's wedding. While the women were working, Chris Hardy, another one of the couple's friends, stopped by to see how the project was going, he and Rebecca both felt an instant connection. Three years later, the pair set plans in motion for their own big day when Chris dropped to one knee at Rebecca's family home in Highlands, North Carolina. END
BEGIN HERE Since the couple responsible for introducing the future Mr. and Mrs. had their wedding at Rebecca's family home, it only made sense that this twosome choose the venue, too. "We didn't want to shop around for a place to get married," the bride says. "We wanted to have our ceremony in a personal space that we both loved. I wanted it to be lovely and artful, and to have the feel of an intimate and relaxed family dinner." And when you're tying the knot at home, it's easy to get just that! END
BEGIN HERE With help from wedding planner Ashley Baber Weddings, florist Amy Osaba Design, and Rebecca's mom, this pair fulfilled their vision of a relaxed, elegant affair on September 26, 2015. Read on to see the photos Haley Sheffield captured of their cozy and colorful fall day. END
BEGIN HERE When it came time to design her invitation suite, Rebecca turned to the friend whose wedding she helped out with all those years before: Abany Bauer of Brown Linen Design. The bride's pal helped the couple created an elegant invite with dainty calligraphy and a monogram they could carry over to the rest of their day. END
BEGIN HERE To welcome their friends and family to Highlands, the bride and groom gifted each guest with a basket stocked with goodies, including sparkling water, snacks, and a guide book. END
BEGIN HERE Rebecca chose a stunning v-neck beaded wedding dress by Jenny Packham. When the weather turned wet on the big day, the bride's dad suggested she swap her Cole Hann pointed heels for her Tretorn rain boots. "At first I thought he was joking, but then I was like, 'Hey, that's actually a really fantastic idea!'" the bride says. END
BEGIN HERE The rain boots tied in with the comfortable vibe of the day, and Rebecca took the opportunity to glam it up with her other finishing touches, like an embellished hair piece, an off-white veil, and her mother's diamond earrings. The bride wanted to honor both of her late grandmothers, so she pinned a brooch that belonged to one onto her bouquet and kept warm in the other's mink stole. "I wanted to wear something of both of theirs," she says. END
BEGIN HERE This groom kept it simple with a dark blue suit from OWNONLY but made sure to have some fun with his socks. Groomsmen wore deep gray suits and joined in the fun with different patterned socks. END
BEGIN HERE Rebecca's bridesmaids wore gold tulle dresses by Jenny Yoo. "I wanted their dresses to be elegant but also fun, and what is more fun than gold tulle? I wanted one!" the bride says. END
BEGIN HERE As a fun gift for her bridesmaids and for the groom's best man, Rebecca hand-sewed award ribbons with a word that best described each person. "I also wrote them each letters about why I thought they exemplified that quality," she says. END
BEGIN HERE With the lush landscape of the home as their ceremony backdrop, Rebecca and Chris were able to keep the rest of their décor minimal. The couple's 120 guests were seated in chairs on the manicured lawn and faced a wooden archway that was decorated in pink roses and plenty of trailing greenery. To mark their aisle, the couple hung swags of flowers from the end chairs. END
BEGIN HERE Anticipating that it would be an emotional day for many of their friends and family, the bride and groom displayed a variety of different vintage handkerchiefs from an iron gate near the ceremony space, with a sign reading "For Happy Tears." END
BEGIN HERE A string quartet played as Rebecca, accompanied by her father, made her way down the aisle. She and Chris exchanged traditional vows, but personalized their ceremony with a special poem that was printed inside their programs for guests to read on their own. END
BEGIN HERE Metallic reception added a dash of glamour to the reception space. Long chestnut tables were decorated with small glowing candles, lush flower arrangements displayed in the bride's mother's antique lusterware pitchers, and a mix of gold and white place settings. With Amy Osaba on hand to design the centerpieces, it's no surprise that the blooms packed a serious punch: Mixes of dahlias, ranunculus, roses, lisianthus, berries, and greenery in a variety of unexpected hues stood out against the neutral color palette. END
BEGIN HERE The bride and her sister created the sequin-covered table numbers and then attached them to birch wood platforms. END
BEGIN HERE The newlyweds served a family-style dinner with farm-fresh roasted corn and squash, salmon, and flank steak. END
BEGIN HERE The couple chose flavors they love for their wedding cake: Alternating layers of chocolate and pumpkin chocolate chip flavored cake were frosted in vanilla icing and dusted with gold glitter. The groom had his own traditional white wedding cake, which was adorably decorated with fondant Minion characters dressed as superheroes. END
BEGIN HERE "I am so glad I took the advice almost everyone told me before the day: Take time out to just appreciate and experience it," Rebecca says. "I would tell future bride's to take a moment to relax, breathe, and take it all in." END

BEGIN HERE While heading to a bridal salon is an exciting adventure (The choices! The accessories! The excitement of finding The Dress!), wouldn't it be amazing if you could try on wedding dresses in the comfort of your home? Just imagine: Your appointment would be as long as you want, you could bring as many friends as you can fit in your living room, and you could sip champagne and nibble on snacks between dresses — not to mention avoiding stripping down to your skivvies in front of a stranger! Well, your dreams are about to come true, and then some. END
BEGIN HERE Meet Floravere, the first custom wedding gown company delivering dresses straight to your door. The company is the brainchild of Molly Kang, a former consultant and corporate strategist who, frustrated by the antiquated process of shopping for her own bridal gown, set out to redefine the wedding dress shopping experience. Says Kang, "A wedding dress is one of the most special purchases a woman will make, yet the process of shopping for one hasn't been updated to reflect the needs of modern brides." She envisioned a way to purchase a luxury gown the same way she shops for the rest of her clothes: online, directly from the producer, and with no appointment necessary. END
BEGIN HERE The result is an opportunity to shop for a custom — and customized — wedding gown in the comfort of your home. Gowns are designed and crafted by former artisans from Monique Lhuillier, Dior, Zac Posen, and Reem Acra, so you know you're getting a stunning and high-quality product. You're also getting amazing perks. Because the dresses are crafted exclusively for Floravere (and there's no storefront involved), all gowns cost under $4,000. Every gown is made to order, so you can tailor the gown to your own style, from changing the sleeve or train to adding monogramming and special details. And it gets even better! Instead of the typical turnaround time of six to nine months, your bespoke Floravere gown will be delivered within 10-15 weeks. Thats four months or less! END
BEGIN HERE Here's how it works: Select up to three styles from the collection (named after fabulous women of literature to boot!) to be shipped to your door in their signature Bride Box (a service that's complimentary with any purchase). Then, invite your friends, pop the champagne, and throw a try-on party to choose the gown that's right for you. Then, return the samples and head to the site to order your gown. They use standard dress sizing instead of bridal sizing, and provide handy tips for measuring to make sure your fit is as close to perfect as possible. END
BEGIN HERE   This gown is perfect for a bride who wants some shimmer. Delicate illusion sleeves and a fitted sweetheart bodice are covered with hand-sewn crystals and beads, while airy layers keep it light and flowing instead of bedazzled and heavy. END

BEGIN HERE Bailon, who is engaged to fiancé Israel Houghton, recently took to Instagram to document her weight loss journey — AND to reveal her secret on how she's been slimming down so fast. The singer-songwriter revealed she's lost a total of 15 pounds so far, and TBH we're a little jealous of her speedy results. On the Instagram video Bailon wrote, "Well folks, I've lost 15 lbs & counting! Can't stop. Won't stop. Focused! It's always tea time in my dress room! Loving my detox with @fittea! Have you joined me?! Um, it's November 1st! The perfect time to start!" END
BEGIN HERE Wait, are you telling us TEA is her weight loss secret? K, we'll guzzle tea for days if it means dropping 15 pounds! END
BEGIN HERE Sadly, Bailon has been subjected to heightened public scrutiny about her weight this year, which she felt the need to address on her talk show, The Real. "I just want to make an announcement," the Cheetah Girl actress told her audience. "I am not pregnant, people. I'm happy! I'm wearing slightly larger clothing." END
BEGIN HERE We'd be happy too with a sparkler like that! Bailon recently gave us a clearer picture of her cushion-cut bling when she traveled to Paris for her 33rd birthday and posted a stunning Insta of herself on a balcony overlooking the Eiffel Tower.

BEGIN HERE I needed an intervention. I needed a tech detox. I challenged myself to do the unheard of: not turn on my iPhone for an entire weekend. END
BEGIN HERE I chose a weekend without travel or plans taking me too far from home, a weekend when my husband was out of town and my schedule was quite open. If I was going to break this habit, I needed space and time for distraction and outdoorsy-ness, and I aimed to make that as simple as possible. Friday night through Sunday night, no phone. I could do this. Right? END
BEGIN HERE I let my family and closest, most-often texted friends know what I intended to do, so that no one would worry, and gave them the name and number of a neighbor to call just in case anything urgent happened. END
BEGIN HERE I set a screen-off time of 7 p.m. Friday, then powered down. I tucked the phone into a drawer so I wouldn't be tempted to check it. I looked at the dog. He looked at me. I guess now we walk? We always walk. I always bring my phone. Not this time. END
BEGIN HERE As we hiked — truly, the only word to describe dog walking in any part of even the most urban places in San Francisco — the urge to reach for my pocket surfaced every couple of minutes. (Was I hearing phantom dings?!) I consciously, and sometimes audibly, reminded myself of what I intended to do, and decided to pay more attention to what was unfolding around me: the dog so happy to be out for an adventure, the fanny-pack clad tourists climbing the stairs, the color of the sky heading into dusk. I live in a beautiful place. There are fascinating people here. I love that dog. Oh, hey, awareness. Good to see you. It turned out to be one of the best walks in recent memory, which I would have missed had I been constantly refreshing my Instagram. END
BEGIN HERE First thing the next morning — thankfully, I awoke at my usual time, sans iPhone alarm (really? I have no back-up plan for an alarm?), I headed off to class, about 1.5 miles away. I usually run there to a high-energy, get-you-up-the-hill playlist. This morning, no music, which, like my alarm, lives comfortably in my iPhone. END
BEGIN HERE I heard my breathing more clearly as I ran, noticed when it regulated (at that sweet spot about five minutes in) and felt more like I was running in nature. There was no distraction of the rectangle tucked into my bra, the soundtrack in my ears and the occasional ding of the early morning texts from family on the opposite coast. END
BEGIN HERE It was a good run. Different. Tougher. But good. Maybe I don't need the phone for this portion of my morning as much as I thought? END
BEGIN HERE In the minutes leading up to class (usually prime phone-checking time), I found myself a little lost for things to do. Read chalkboard. Look at merchandise. Oh, hang on, there are a whole bunch of people here I can speak to. Never a shy person, just sometimes distracted by that really important work e-mail I have to deal with right now, I locked eyes with another student a few feet away and launched into a conversation (obviously, about ClassPass). END
BEGIN HERE Turns out, we go to many of the same studios, like many of the same kinds of classes and live nearby. Maybe we'll meet for a run or drinks sometime? I had to ask her to text me her info and told her I'd be in touch after the following evening, when I was off my phone sabbatical. Strike one against being phone-free: Having that device handy right then would have saved some awkwardness, but all things told, it was fine. I knew that text would be waiting when I checked tomorrow. END
BEGIN HERE Later that day, I ventured out with the dog to check out the farmers' market, something we love to do on the weekends when my husband travels. It's prime people-watching territory and prime photo-taking terrain: gorgeous views of the piers and bridges, palm-tree lined thoroughfares, and the seemingly endless bay. When we got out to the water — after a podcast-free walk (how would I know what happened in the news without NPR? I wondered) but a new appreciation for the traffic patterns of the human species — I had to choke back a sad little realization that I couldn't take pictures today. Was it even worth being there? END
BEGIN HERE Whoa. Gross, I thought to myself. Am I coming here to take pictures just to be able to show them off? That was a super informative moment (and earlier into my experiment than I would have expected!). I made a mental note to myself: Your life is lived right now. It's valid right now, exactly as it is and as it happens. Not because someone later looks at a captured moment and decides that moment was likable. END
BEGIN HERE I shook that off and continued on the adventure to the market. I was going to get every single sensory thing from this, the sounds, the sights, the smells, even if I couldn't capture it and share it with everyone I know later. It was a wonderfully present, educational trip. I learned about mushrooms, and I didn't have to Google a single thing. END
BEGIN HERE That evening, I had plans to meet a girlfriend for dinner and drinks across town. I knew the neighborhood and cross-streets I was headed to, but not exactly how to get there. I packed a book in my bag, walked to the corner and waited for the bus. You'd be so proud: I went the whole time without checking an app incessantly to see when the next one would come. Lo and behold, without checking, a bus did eventually show up. Perhaps all that checking, checking, checking isn't productive at all? I definitely read more pages in my book, sans iPhone disruption. I read on the bus, too, a far more calming transit activity than trying to organize e-mail or calendar events. END
BEGIN HERE When I got off the bus, I didn't know which direction to go, so I asked a couple standing nearby. Just like that! Just asked them. And they told me. And they recommended the sweet potato fries. Ah yes, the value add of a real human! END
BEGIN HERE I found my way there, no maps app required, and spent a lovely evening out with a great friend, not worrying about taking photos or Instagramming our time or worrying that I was missing texts. I probably was missing texts, but at some point, it dawned on me that it was probably okay. There probably wasn't anything urgent unfolding (and if there was, my neighbor would let me know when I got home). It was so beautiful to get to just focus on being exactly where I was, not fretting about what was happening someplace else. END
BEGIN HERE When it came time to head home, I automatically reached into my bag for my phone to call an Uber. Oops. I guess that wouldn't be an option tonight. I felt truly vintage fabulous as I stepped off the curb to hail a cab. How old school, I thought, having not hailed a cab since my induction into the Cult of the Uber Obsessed 18 months prior. Instead of burying myself in my phone for the trip, I rolled down the window and took in this part of town I didn't know well and appreciated its twinkly streets. There is something to be said for paying attention to what's going on around you. END
BEGIN HERE The next day — Sunday — was my last nearly full day without a phone. I decided to go full-force low-tech and drove out to the beach with the dog. I printed a set of directions from the computer (willing myself not to look at Facebook or email while I was on there — I figured I should keep up this behavior on any device if I could help it) and packed it in my bag with a guide book to the hiking trails of the Bay Area a friend had loaned me weeks earlier. If I needed to look something up, I'd be using this well-loved paperback, not the Google machine. END
BEGIN HERE I managed to get us to the coast without Siri's guidance, only getting turned around and kind of frustrated once. I even discovered a new station on the radio. Again, how vintage. Maybe I would revisit that on my next drive instead of going back to the same playlists I always listened to. Navigation! Problem-solving! Newness! Intrigue! Being without a phone was affording me so much growth, I laughed to myself as I unloaded the dog and headed off down the cliffs for a photo-free, music-free, text-free outdoor adventure. END

BEGIN HERE Turns out, the ocean is even more beautiful when you're actually looking at it. Turns out, too, that without constantly looking at the time or for an iMessage update from someone, the minutes take on an entirely different quality. We were on that beach for four hours; it felt like not more than a few seconds. I was more aware of the subtle qualities of the space around me: the birds, the water, the other hundreds of dogs, and more willing to engage with the other humans in that same space. Turns out, they're also really intriguing, more intriguing than Facebook, when you take half a second to find out. I left the beach feeling alive and like I had really experienced a cool part of the city. It wouldn't have been the same without the phone. END
BEGIN HERE Using my newfound direction-finding skills, I got us home without getting lost, picked up groceries (without using an electronic shopping list or grocery-delivery app) and wrote three letters to friends, something I do regularly, but this time, I chose friends I tend only to email. It felt connected, it felt real. I was happier to drop those in the mailbox than I usually felt when I hit "send." END
BEGIN HERE What had this weekend become? I did a little body scan to see if I noticed anything different in my person. END
BEGIN HERE I felt solid but light. (Perhaps because I hadn't been looking at my phone during meals. Did I actually manage to stop eating when I was full all weekend?!) I felt clear in my head, like I knew where I was and was appreciating what was unfolding around me. My hands, usually a bit twingy, especially around my super texting tendons, didn't hurt. Had they had a real break? Was I maybe reducing my risk of developing talon-like claws from my constant phone-holding? END
BEGIN HERE More than anything, I felt calm. Things didn't feel urgent. I wasn't being constantly reminded by push notifications or dinged or pinged or flashed at. Everything had assumed a quietness that felt manageable. I didn't feel behind or under-accomplished in my day, something I usually felt while the emails piled up or the excitement of others' Facebook posts filled my subconscious with doubts about how I was spending my time. What's that about?, I asked aloud as the realization surfaced. I felt totally content with my weekend because I'd been in it. I'd paid attention to all its little moments. I wasn't doing anything with the intention of snapping a photo of it to share while it was still happening. END
BEGIN HERE It had just... been. And I was so happy. END
BEGIN HERE When 7 p.m. rolled around, I somewhat begrudgingly took the phone from its hiding spot and powered it on. I texted my husband to let him know I was still alive and back on the little black box. Then I turned off the ringer, set it on the counter and went back outside with the dog. I wanted another of those beautifully present dusk walks. Sans phone. END

BEGIN HERE Most couples know that there are items from their wedding that they'd like to save, but are unsure of what to do next. If you are a lover of traditions and looking forward to passing your wedding heirlooms on through the generations on your family, it will take a bit of advance planning. From your shoes, to your garter, to your wedding day signage, there are so many great wedding memories that you can preserve. Wedding keepsakes take time to gather and advance planning to save, so while it doesn't seem necessary now, it's important to think about in advance. Here is a list of possible items to save and some advice for planning ahead to preserve those wedding day moments most precious to you. END
BEGIN HERE   Saving items from your wedding doesn't always mean you stuff them in the box and never look at them again. There are many items that are usable after your wedding and are considered wedding keepsakes. Your bridal shoes are a great example of something that is perfectly useable after your wedding, if you choose the right pair of shoes that you love. Additionally, there are many guest book options, such as furniture, or live paintings and signs that can be used day-to-day in your married life. END

"We're trying to figure out where it's going to be," Rodgers previously shared with E! News. "We have family in California, family in Dallas..." he explained.

BEGIN HERE Last week we reported that Mariah Carey and her fiancé James Packer have sadly called it quits. But the plot thickens: the pop star is apparently demanding $50 million from her billionaire ex-beau because it was stated on their unsigned prenup — even though they're, er, not getting married! END
BEGIN HERE According to TMZ, MiMi is asking for a $50 million check which she would have received upon Packer signing off on the prenup. Talk about a pretty sweet wedding gift from your now ex-hubs! This is where it gets sticky: In the prenup, it was noted that any jewelry Packer gave the singer would be returned to him — but that she was entitled to $50 million if she and her beau were to break up. Well, here we are at the end result, and songbird is looking for some cold hard cash. END
BEGIN HERE Word on the street was that the Australian billionaire actually wanted to lock down the prenup asap, as he wanted to marry Ms. Carey in Bora Bora this past spring in a commitment ceremony — even though she is still legally married to Nick Cannon. Being that the doc was so complicated, it took a little longer than expected for their lawyers to peruse, and then the trouble in paradise (not literally, unfortunately for the duo) began. END
BEGIN HERE The two reportedly broke up when Carey had some sort of secret "meeting" with a backup dancer at her Vegas show (which was to be exposed on her upcoming reality show). As you know, the Australian billionaire wanted nothing to do with his fianceé's reality show, and it spawned their breakup. "It's all over," a close family friend told Woman's Day. "James had huge reservations about Mariah's new reality TV show and the fact that she was willing to expose their lives to the world." END
BEGIN HERE With all of this legal back and forth, it will be interesting to see if the hitmaker gets her $50 mil. With a closet full of Grammys and a reality show in the works, you never know when you might need some new shoes. Pouring one out for this power couple (and perhaps Packer's bank account). Although when you're a billionaire, what's a measly $50 mil check? Ahh, must be the life. END
BEGIN HERE This Victoria's Secret Angel now has both her wings and a wedding ring! (Lucky girl...) Brazilian model Isabeli Fontana — whose credits include the lingerie giant, Versace, Ralph Lauren, and Sports Illustrated — just married Diego Ferrero in the Maldives. So what does one wear for a beautiful beachy wedding like that? Well, a bridal white bikini naturally! Wait — what?! END
BEGIN HERE Yes, for her wedding day, Fontana wore nothing save for a completely sheer sheath, which showed off her sexy swimsuit underneath. (See the gorgeous photos below.) Only a Victoria's Secret model could get away with wearing a bikini to her wedding. Actually, scratch that! What's stopping you from exchanging your big tulle ball gown for an itty bitty bikini? END
BEGIN HERE Should we really be so surprised that a bride who has graced the pages of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue would wear a swimsuit to her nuptials? And look damn good in it, we might add! On August 9, the supermodel and her sweetheart headed to the sandy shores of the Maldives to tie the knot, setting the stage for their beachy big day with message-in-a-bottle inspired wedding invitations. According to WhoWhatWear, the sheer sheath Fontana wore for her "I do's" was a custom design by Agua de Coco, a Brazilian swimwear label (no shocker there, right?). The daring look included leaf-motif beading along the super sheer tulle, with Fontana rocking a strapless bikini top and high-waisted bikini bottom underneath. How's that for a unique bridal style? END
BEGIN HERE In her wedding photos (below), Fontana and her new hubby can be seen embracing in the sand and surf after getting hitched under a heart-shaped arch adorned with sea grass — even standing on a set of wooden stairs in the middle of the ocean. But hey, if a unexpected wave splashed up, who cares? This bride's wedding ensemble is totally conducive to taking a quick dip after the "I do's." END
BEGIN HERE Maybe there's actually a few more benefits to this out-there wedding day look than we originally thought... If you get overheated from dancing the night away, you're all set to cool off in the surf. No need to even do a quick change. Hmm... END

BEGIN HERE Wedding registries are incredibly useful — not to mention fun to set up (hello, scanner gun and visions of your tricked-out home!) — but can also be a source of confusion. Do you have to have one? What can you put on it? How do you tell your guests about it? So we've rounded up the top five wedding registry etiquette questions, and turned to the experts for the answers. END
BEGIN HERE   First things first: your wedding registry information should not be printed on your wedding invitation. Instead, include the information on your wedding website, then either print the URL on your invitation or include it on an invitation insert. (Bonus: You can also use this card to direct your guests to your room block information, as well!) If you've registered at national brands, let your parents and wedding party know where, so they can answer any questions they might get from your family members or other guests. The one exception to printing registry information on an invitation? The invitation to your bridal shower. Since this event is traditionally an opportunity for guests to help you set up your home, it's perfectly acceptable for your bridal shower invite to read "Susan is registered at...". END
BEGIN HERE There are so many decisions you have to make when it comes to planning your wedding. From picking a venue to choosing your dress and flowers, the list can seem never-ending.

BEGIN HERE A few short months after Taylor Wolff moved from Los Angeles to Melbourne, Australia, she attended a local friend's goodbye party, and spotted Adam Syarc. "I sat down next to him and we clicked immediately," Taylor remembers. They had been dating for almost three and a half years when, overlooking Melbourne from Adam's best friend's parents' rooftop, Adam spontaneously proposed. Says Taylor, "He didn't even have a ring — he used his friend's grandmother's wedding band. It meant a lot because his friend's grandparents had been married for 55 years." A month later, Adam and his fiancée headed back to where they'd had their first date, and he presented Taylor with a beautiful ring he'd designed himself. END
BEGIN HERE Though the pair lives in Australia, the knew they wanted to have their wedding in America. Palm Springs was relatively accessible, and had a special place in Taylor's heart: She grew up visiting her grandparents in the area. "We wanted somewhere our guests could join us for the weekend and really get to know one another as our worlds collided. We chose Smoke Tree Ranch because we could all stay on the property. It felt like adult summer camp!" Taylor describes. While planning a wedding from across an ocean was a challenge, a fantastic wedding planner, The Events Department, and a close family friend who served as a stylist helped Taylor and Adam create a desert chic wedding that was fun and family-focused. From towering cacti and Persian rugs to vibrant flowers and a few DIY projects tackled by Taylor's maid of honor, this wedding was personal, stylish, and unique. Check out the photos by Claire Eliza! END
BEGIN HERE Taylor and her 'maids spent the morning of April 22, 2016, reminiscing and getting gussied up before the bride donned her Anne Barge wedding dress, striped with ribbon over a champagne-hued lining. Her bridesmaids chose grey Joanna August maxi dresses in a variety of styles. END
BEGIN HERE She and Adam chose to not see one another until the ceremony, so instead Taylor had an emotional first look with her father. END
BEGIN HERE Taylor loved her gown's Art Deco-vibe, and we're obsessed with how it matched the graphic stripes on Adam's socks! She finished her look with side-swept waves and a vibrant bouquet of anemones and peonies. END
BEGIN HERE Adam wanted a Rat Pack vibe for his groomsmen, so they all wore navy tuxedos with tailored white shirts. His nephews served as page boys, in suit shorts and bow ties, and carried signs down the aisle, leading Taylor to Adam once the ceremony was underway. "They talked about their jobs for months, and all weekend couldn't wait to put their outfits on!" Taylor remembers. END
BEGIN HERE The ceremony took place in the middle of the road, with rugs serving as an aisle runner and umbrellas arranged to protect guests from the desert sun. END
BEGIN HERE The couple had a traditional ceremony, with Taylor's parents escorting her down the aisle as she and Adam saw one another for the first time. While the weather had been calm all week, a crazy wind storm came through just a few minutes before the ceremony. "It could have caused a few freak outs, and we had to skip our table assignments or else they would have blown away, but it made for some beautiful pictures and funny moments," says Taylor of the gust that caught her veil — so much so that Adam ended up wrapping the veil around him during the recessional so it wouldn't carry his bride away! END
BEGIN HERE The desert backdrop was totally stunning, full of unique varieties of cacti that made for an incredible settings for portraits. END
BEGIN HERE Says Taylor, "Planning our wedding was so fun, even from afar! I loved doing the research and collaborate with our vendors, my mom, and our stylist. It also forced us to go with our gut, since we didn't have the opportunity to go back and consider other options or ideas." END
BEGIN HERE At the outdoor reception, farm tables were surrounded with cross-back chairs. Instead of big centerpieces, the pair chose more simple garland arrangements — a choice that worked well for serving their family-style meal. Greenery and vines were accented with vibrant blooms, and wine was poured into delicate gold-rimmed glasses. "My mom sets a great table, so she was in charge of all the rentals," says Taylor. END
BEGIN HERE At the bar, guests grabbed Aperol spritzes and California wines. For dinner, family-style trays of salmon and steak were passed around each table, and guests could dig into as much or as little as they'd like. "It really encouraged everyone to mingle and get to know each other better," the bride says. END
BEGIN HERE We adore the couple's photo booth, set up inside a vintage VW Bus and decorated with vintage-inspired props and baskets of flowers. Next to the dance floor, a lounge area of mid-century furniture encouraged guests to relax between the DJ's sets. END
BEGIN HERE Adam and Taylor's first dance was to "Let's Stay Together" by Marvin Gaye before letting their DJ take over. "We had so much fun working with him. We had one song we wanted to play, where our guests would get on the ground and Adam and I would pop up and dance furiously. It was everything I'd envisioned!" END
BEGIN HERE Instead of cake, the pair served a spread of donuts — including ones that spelled out "Taylor Adam!" Flavors included funfetti, maple bacon, coconut, chocolate, and red velvet. END

BEGIN HERE During an interview with The Kylie & Jackie O Show, Kunis, who is expecting her second child with her former That '70s Show co-star, discussed values that she feels are important for her children to have, especially when being raised by such successful, wealthy parents, according to E! News. END
BEGIN HERE "The one topic of conversation we had even prior to ever having kids was always how do you raise a child to not be an a-hole?" the mom of toddler Wyatt Isabelle said. "And it's so important because we both came from pretty, pretty, solid poverty backgrounds and grew up very poor and are very much self-made and are very aware of what a dollar is worth." END

While on the road promoting her new upcoming movie Bad Moms, she has been talking about how women shouldn't worry about having to be the perfect parents and how perfect parents don't exist. She also revealed how becoming a parent has changed her. END
BEGIN HERE "It does change the way you think and look at life," Kunis told Entertainment Tonight. "I would never trade it for the world. I know that when we decided to have a kid, we were ready to no longer be selfish. Or at least start the process, because innately, as humans, we are really selfish people." END

After throwing the wedding of their dreams earlier this month in a luxurious Los Angeles ceremony, the married couple has now jet-set to one of the most romantic places on earth: Bora Bora, of course! Their gorgeous, honeymoon island escape is giving us all major bouts of envy, TBH. END
BEGIN HERE Johnson, who first met Herjavec on the 20th season of Dancing With the Stars, looked absolutely radiant in her white "Mrs." swimsuit and adorable straw hat. She posted the photo on her Instagram account, which now has the handle @kymherjavec5678 awww, and gave shout outs to the companies who graciously gifted her with top-notch honeymoon style. Ya know, in case you want to rock that bathing suit on your honeymoon with bae. END
BEGIN HERE It seems like Johnson isn't the only one enjoying soaking up the sun, either. Her new hubby couldn't help but flaunt his incredible, blue water view on his Instagram page saying, "No filter! Work hard, play hard — repeat!" We bet THAT makes the Shark Tank sharks puh-retty jealous, no? Whether or not they really are is up in the air, but it's hard to deny that Herjavec and Johnson's love isn't envy worthy. END
BEGIN HERE When the Shark Tank star proposed back in February, the couple were sure the last thing they wanted to do was wait a long time before walking down the aisle. "Why waste time?" Johnson told ET Online. And as for their DWTS co-stars, they could tell it was love at first sight. "I think it was instant," Derek Hough told ET. "When I found out they were dancing together I was like, first of all, that's the man of her dreams. The fact that he felt the same about her — I couldn't be happier for them." END

BEGIN HERE The week leading up to your wedding is undoubtedly the most exciting, busy, and emotional time of your life. With last minute to-dos, arrangements, phone calls, confirmations and more — it's the last bit of time to ensure everything is a-ok and ready to go. While it's completely normal to feel a bit anxiously motivated to accomplish some last minute endeavors you otherwise hadn't thought of until now — refrain! Trust us, you'll definitely want to avoid doing these four things during your wedding week. END
BEGIN HERE   Cold feet and pre-wedding anxiety are natural for many brides-to-be, especially the week before the big day. But making any last minute decisions should be avoided at all costs — however big or small. Unless any circumstances change that are beyond your control, everything you have decided and chosen has been carefully thought over and planned, and should not be amended at such a vulnerable and hectic time. Calm your nerves and second guesses by channeling confidence in the decisions you have made, and know that your wedding will be everything you wanted it to be. END
BEGIN HERE Of course we want you to have fun at your own wedding. But as Amy Nichols, owner of Amy Nichols Special Events and co-founder of The Poppy Group, points out, making your wedding a fun experience for guests is a major component to pulling off a successful wedding. "There are probably 50 to 250 more people who are also choosing to spend five-plus hours with you, so it is important to keep their comfort and enjoyment in mind," Nichols said. So here's how to ensure that yours is the most fun wedding reception your guests will ever attend — trust us. END
BEGIN HERE   Your guests may have the nibbles after an intense workout on the dance floor. If you feed them a snack in the wee hours of your wedding, Fisher says, they'll be forever grateful. "Treat guests to some of your local favorites with a late-night food station guaranteed to give everyone the extra energy needed to keep the party going," the Philadelphia-based planner suggests, adding that, "Philly soft pretzels, Philly cheesesteaks, and Federal Donuts are among the favorites of my Philadelphia couples." END
BEGIN HERE What comes next after the question is popped? Why, the engagement photo shoot, of course! It's time to share your huge, life-changing news with the world and show 'em how happy you are as you start this new, exciting journey. That's just what this California woman did when her new employer popped the question — of a job offer! Yep, a marriage isn't the only kind of proposal that warrants a photo shoot — at least according to Benita Abraham who took a slew of super cutesy snapshots normally warranted for a lovey-dovey couple — but with her offer of employment. These might just be our favorite engagement photos yet... END
BEGIN HERE After seven long months of job hunting Benita Abraham of Long Beach, California, had finally found the ~~man~~ job of her dreams. And naturally, took a series of precious photographs to commemorate the celebratory occasion. "I finally found my soulmate, my perfect match, my boo," Abraham captioned the photos on her Facebook page. "After 7 long months, I found the perfect job with a company that truly cares about its employees and one I will learn so much from." While this funny lady might have gotten a gig and not a ring, all of the snapshots are based on typical poses newly-engaged couples do in their proposal photoshoots. "notjustforbabiesmarriagesandbirthdays," Abraham hashtagged the pics. END
BEGIN HERE In the photos, Abraham lies on the beach, embracing her framed job offer with a "I said yes!" chalkboard sign. In others,, the cute couple (a.k.a.

(Bronzing primer, $49, Colorescience) END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Getty Images    END

Enter Mineral Fusion Mineral SPF 30 Brush-On Sun Defense. This transparent powder can be used over any makeup, on bare skin and even dusted into your hairline and part to protect you from the sun with zero mess.

BEGIN HERE Take it from us — you're going to be doing a lot of kissing on your honeymoon!

BEGIN HERE Throughout their eight years of dating, Gary Rosenberg made sure he stuck to one important Valentine's Day tradition: he always gifted Jill Badlotto a new teddy bear on the romantic holiday, which she kept and treasured over the course of their relationship. So when Jill came home to find each of those bears lined up on the patio, with the very first plush toy with a ring box in his paw and Gary on bended knee beside him, the bride-to-be happily accepted the sentimental proposal. END
BEGIN HERE Like those gifts and the day the Gary popped the question, the future Mr. and Mrs. wanted their October 24, 2015, wedding to stand the test of time. "It was important for me to look back on our day in 20 years and not feel it was too trendy," says Jill. The couple turned to their grandparents' weddings, as well as Jackie Kennedy Onassis, for inspiration. With a classic color palette of ivory and maroon, the couple ensured no detail would ever go out of style. And, thanks to the talents of Charlotte Jenks Lewis, they can look back on the happy memories forever. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Charlotte Jenks Lewis    END
BEGIN HERE Using invitations from Minted, Jill and Gary invited 97 guests to join them in Brooklyn, New York, for a ceremony at the bride's childhood church followed by a reception at The Players club, a private townhouse for actors, writers, and artists. "The décor of the venue is unlike any other, with a poker table that Frank Sinatra played at, and the untouched bedroom of Edwin Booth," the bride says. "After receiving a tour of the place, I knew it had to be my venue, and that my guests would be in awe like I was. When you step foot into The Players, you are transported back into old Hollywood. It's a pretty magical place." END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Charlotte Jenks Lewis    END
BEGIN HERE Despite the heavy head-to-toe lace on Jill's Oscar de la Renta wedding dress, she says it was light and comfortable. The dress came strapless, but Jill added tulle off-the-shoulder straps to give her big day look a dash of whimsical flair. "All the other dresses made me feel like I was playing dress up in bridal gowns, but when I tried on this one, I felt like I was a bride," Jill says. "Also, my mom started crying, which was a good indication I had found the one." END
BEGIN HERE But as much as she loved her wedding dress, it was a wedding day accessory that she was most excited to wear. "I'll admit I was almost as excited for my veil as I was my dress," Jill says. Knowing she wanted something that felt like an antique, the bride-to-be sought out a store in Chicago that could create a custom veil using vintage fabrics and lace. Although she went into the boutique looking to have something designed just for her, the owner showed Jill a dramatic headpiece from the 1920s. END
BEGIN HERE Jill's nude-hued Christian Louboutin pumps were a wedding day gift from Gary, and served as her something new. As for her something blue, the bride wore a blue bracelet that was once her grandmother's around her ankle. END
BEGIN HERE She knew exactly what she wanted for her bouquet, choosing immediately to carry a small bundle of Lily of the Valley. "Growing up, my mother would grow them in her garden," Jill says, "and I loved the delicate nature of the flower." END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Charlotte Jenks Lewis    END
BEGIN HERE Gary's one and only wedding request? That he could pair a bow tie with his classic black and white tuxedo, which each of his groomsmen also wore for the big day. "Gary loves color and loud prints, so the bow tie was a way for him to show his personality on our wedding day, and added some color to our neutral color palette," says Jill. END
BEGIN HERE The groom also chose not to shave his beard for the couple's black-tie-optional wedding. "Everyone wondered why he didn't," Jill says, "but I love his beard, and that's how he's most comfortable, so he kept it. And I'm so happy he did." END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Charlotte Jenks Lewis    END
BEGIN HERE "It's old Italian tradition for the bridesmaids and maid-of-honor to wear white on the wedding day, so that the bad spirits will get confused as to who the bride is," Jill says. In love with that idea, the bride asked her friends to choose their own ivory gown to wear on the day. "It all came out beautiful, and I loved that the overall look was cohesive, but each girl was unique in her own way. One design doesn't always have to fit all." END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Charlotte Jenks Lewis    END
BEGIN HERE Jill and Gary returned to the bride's childhood church for their ceremony. "My father walked me down the same aisle he walked down with my mom, the same aisle he held me down when I was baptized, and the same aisle he watched me receive communion," Jill says. "He is a very tough guy, but when it comes to his family, he is very sensitive, so it was an emotional moment for us." END
BEGIN HERE Luckily, because of the old building's breathtaking architecture, the couple needed little in the way of décor. "We let the stained glass windows and dramatic look of the church speak for itself." END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Charlotte Jenks Lewis    END
BEGIN HERE Inside the reception venue, guests could take in framed portraits of Jimmy Fallon, Mark Twain, Walter Cronkite, and more on the townhouse's colorful walls. During cocktail hour, the couple offered guests one of their favorite foods: macaroni and cheese. "It was very important to Gary and I that our wedding day was a reflection of us as a couple," the bride says. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Charlotte Jenks Lewis    END
BEGIN HERE Thanks to The Players own unique décor, Jill and Gary didn't have to do much to dress up the space. "I didn't want to take away from it's beauty," Jill says. Tables were topped with ivory linens, candles, and tall centerpieces of baby's breath so guests could chat with each other across the table. END
BEGIN HERE Jill's brother, an artist, hand-drew a picture of the Brooklyn Bridge, which the couple copied and gave out as favors to their guests. "He is so incredibly talented, and I love that it's a souvenir that they can take home to remember their trip to New York," says the bride. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Charlotte Jenks Lewis    END
BEGIN HERE Dessert was an epic ice cream sundae bar, but that didn't mean the couple skipped a wedding cake. In addition to scoops of their favorite flavors, guests also enjoyed traditional vanilla cake with buttercream frosting. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Charlotte Jenks Lewis    END
BEGIN HERE The couple danced together to Elvis Presley's "Can't Help Falling In Love," then opened up the floor to their guests. "For the last song, we requested 'New York, New York' by Frank Sinatra, and my husband and I got up on stage to sing," Jill ssays. "It was one of my favorite parts of the night." END
BEGIN HERE Jill doesn't regret going with her gut when it comes to wedding planning, and encourages other brides to do the same. "Do what you want," she says. "I had so many people tell me that having different bridesmaids dresses would look sloppy, or that I was spending too much money on a certain thing. We didn't listen to any of it, and everything came together perfectly. Don't sweat the small stuff also, because at the end of the day, nothing else matters but the love you two share. It will all come together." END

BEGIN HERE While a guest can get away with just a night or two out of town for a friend's wedding, when you're the bride or groom, there's a lot more to get done in the days leading up to your wedding day. From final details to greeting arriving family to cherishing those last moments before you become a wife, the thought of going to work is probably the last thing on your mind — and could be cramping your pre-wedding style. So how many days can you really take off before you walk down the aisle? Our experts weigh in. END
BEGIN HERE You'll definitely want to save as many vacation days as possible for your honeymoon, but having the chance to take off a day or two before your wedding to really focus on what's left on your to-do list can be incredibly helpful (as can the extra time to meet your bridesmaids for pedicures or pack up those welcome bags!). If you plan on taking any time off, make sure to submit your vacation request as early as possible. Sure, your manager will probably squeeze you into the calendar because you're The Bride, but particularly if you're getting married during a busy travel season, it's in your best interest to make sure you're not the last person left who has to man the office while everyone is gone for a holiday weekend. END
BEGIN HERE When it comes to the days after your wedding, consider trying to take at least one day off (most likely Monday) so you can get plenty of sleep and recuperate after your wild night. That is, of course, if you aren't heading straight to your honeymoon! Even if it's an extra night at the hotel or just a quiet night eating pizza on the couch with your new husband, knowing you have a little time to take a nap, relax, and scroll through Instagram looking for peeks of your reception will make going back to work a little bit easier.

The inspiration? A dress straight from Marchesa's fall 2011 runway the model fell in love with (above). She did make some alterations to the style, opting for a sleeker silhouette, and thin spaghetti straps instead of embroidered bold shoulders. Christian Louboutin was the man on her feet. END

BEGIN HERE Every bride wants her wedding gown to be unique, so how can she create a look that's completely her own? When it comes to custom wedding gowns, it all comes down to communication, and a little bit of imagination too. These Etsy vendors know exactly what goes into making it happen. END
BEGIN HERE "Custom gowns are for any bride looking to personalize her wedding day style, and the bride who finds bits and pieces of dresses she loves and wants to combine them into one dress," says Amanda Jennings of MinkMaidsCollection in Wisconsin. END
BEGIN HERE As far as inspiration goes, Yanique Barnes of Dreamers and Lovers in Los Angeles, CA, says to start by looking inside your own closet. That natural fashion sense, knowing what you look best in and feel comfortable wearing, will help determine what kind of silhouette will flatter your body type. Then, find a designer who shares your aesthetic. And that means everything from the cut to the color to the fabric. Make sure your chosen designer has experience with the type of fabrics you want to work with, and is willing to create the kind of gown you're envisioning. Whether you're looking for something out of the ordinary or simply want something locally made, chances are you'll be able to find a few pros who've created everything from vegan to maternity wedding gowns, if you scour the internet. END
BEGIN HERE Probably the most important aspect of ordering a custom gown is discussing the overall process. "It's imperative, when ordering a custom design, that the bride-to-be has had a full discussion about the designer's process," Barnes says. It's good to ask for a sketch to make sure that that his or her interpretation is exactly what you have in mind. And it's probably not a good idea to bring a photo of an already existing gown and ask for a duplicate. "Hopefully the designer would refuse to do so for reasons of integrity, but even if she attempts to do so, inevitably the fabrics, cut, and other details will probably turn out slightly different because of her own hand, eye, and skills," says Rebecca Schoneveld of Brooklyn, NY. END
BEGIN HERE As you might expect, fully custom-made designs can often be nearly double the price of an off-the-rack piece, says Barnes. Think of all the time and care that goes into the design and manufacture. It's an intensive process for just one dress. Still, independent sellers on sites like Etsy might be more within your budget. Jennings adds that some designers can work within a bride's budget if she's open to design modifications. "Simplifying the silhouette, removing intricate details or inner construction, and using different fabrications will all help to reduce the cost of a gown," she says. END
BEGIN HERE Keep in mind that most designers aren't in a position to offer refunds on custom pieces. So Barnes recommends making sure all correspondence is clear in emails so you're more likely to end up with your dream dress. What's more, Schoneveld thinks it's a really good idea to try on a muslin, or mock-up, of the gown before it's cut in the actual fabric. You should be 100% sure of the proportions and the design before the final piece is made. Then, rest assured that you'll be getting a wedding gown that's truly one-of-a-kind. If your chosen designer is out of state, Barnes suggests seeing a professional seamstress nearby to take your proper measurements. END

BEGIN HERE This is it... The final countdown to your big day. And along with settling those last few details — figuring out where to seat your eccentric Uncle Carl, firming up the flowers, deciding on your first dance song — you're likely also making one last push to make sure the body that will be wearing that gorgeous white gown looks as good as it possibly can.

BEGIN HERE It doesn't matter how beautiful or entertaining your wedding reception is, if you've planned your wedding on a date that coincides with an important football game, in my professional opinion, you're pretty much sunk. Let me tell you why. END
BEGIN HERE I had a fall wedding group a couple of years ago that had only one wedding date option when they hired me — it had to be on the only Saturday that the Ohio State Buckeyes had a week off. The father of the bride wasn't willing to go ANYWHERE if the Buckeyes had a game, or if there was the possibility of a playoff. So we planned around him. END
BEGIN HERE You might think it's ridiculous to plan the most important day of your life around a sporting event — and it probably is — but if you want to ensure that the die-hard fans in your group will actually be present and accounted for when you get married, you have to think about game-day date conflicts. END
BEGIN HERE True Story: A wedding I planned fell on the same night as a playoff game. The bride did not want the television going in the wedding venue, but her father and his friends kept turning it back on. As a result, the guests were broken up into small groups — with some of them glued to the screen — and the party wasn't getting going the way it should with half of the guests distracted. The bride was distraught. END
BEGIN HERE I kept shooing the guests back outside to the party, but then somebody would yell or cheer, and all the guys would go rushing back into the villa to see what had happened. When the father of the bride told me hold off on the daddy/daughter dance for a bit because they'd just gotten a first down, I became just as frustrated as the already-furious bride. END
BEGIN HERE  Watch This Groom Totally Surprise His Bride With an Epic Wedding Dance END
BEGIN HERE My solution? I went outside, around the back of the villa, and disconnected the satellite dish. And pocketed the connector, just in case somebody got the brilliant idea to check the hookup. END
BEGIN HERE My husband, meanwhile, pretended to be watching the game with the crew. When the screen went blank, he told the guests it happens all the time on tropical islands. That's true, just not in this particular case. After quite a bit of grumbling and complaining, the football fans rejoined the rest of the wedding guests at the reception, and we finally had a daddy/daughter dance. END
BEGIN HERE Fortunately, for me, nobody ever figured out that the signal loss was less than an act of God. I reconnected the cable before the bride tossed her bouquet, and the TV was back on when everybody went back inside at the end. But I was lucky. And I hope I never have to do it again, because I totally would. END
BEGIN HERE While we'd all like to believe that our loved ones consider our wedding day far more important than any sporting event, but it's better to put things in perspective, and make a smart decision when you choose your date. END

BEGIN HERE First comes the rose, then comes the moving van! Less than two weeks after  The Bachelorette finale aired and we all watched JoJo Fletcher present her finale rose to her now-fiancé Jordan Rodgers (while simultaneously squealing at our TV screens and downing glasses of rosé, of course), the to-be-wed pair are officially shacking up! Fletcher and Rodgers just took another major step in their relationship, as they moved in together in their new Dallas, Texas digs. And best of all, they documented every step of their trek on social media for all to see! Can you say score? END
BEGIN HERE They're one step closer to the altar, y'all! (Still crossing our fingers that we get to watch their "I do's" on TV...) Fletcher and Rodgers have only been able to flaunt their relationship in public for a matter of days (the too-cute couple were forced to keep their love under wraps until the finale aired), but now these two are out and about — and taking on a major relationship milestone. The Bachelorette couple took what looks like an epic road trip from Tennessee to Texas to move into their nearly-wed nest in Dallas. And these photos will have you wishing that you were riding shotgun! END
BEGIN HERE "DALLAS — we are coming home!! 10 hour road trip... HERE. WE. GO," Fletcher tweeted at about 4:30 Wednesday morning, as the couple began their journey bright and early. But as chipper as the former Bachelorette sounded, she soon dozed off — leaving her almost-hubby to document her zzz's in the most hilarious set of tweets and snaps! END
BEGIN HERE "The JoJosleepswatch2016 is underway on this road trip. 25min and counting," Rodgers wrote. "46 min in and we have movement," he later updated his fans, but it looks like he spoke too soon. "FALSE ALARM folks... just a nose itch and a reposition. Back on the clock!" Too funny! Rodgers even took a few snapshots of his sleeping fiancé. Again, why weren't we riding shotgun for all of this?! END

Her soon-to-be husband stepped up [and] decked the guy... The cops ended up being called and they had to haul him out. Afterwords, everybody just stood there until the groom took out a handkerchief, wiped her tears and then his bloody nose, took her hand and turned to the altar again. He just quietly then said 'Please continue, Father,' to the priest and they did, hand in hand." END
BEGIN HERE "At one wedding, the bride's mother stood up and objected. She said, 'I love you, [groom], and I don't want anyone else as a son in law. But my daughter is exactly like me, and I wouldn't be able to let this wedding continue if I didn't warn you about the mess we make out of the lives of people we love. Make sure you want this,' then sat back down." END
BEGIN HERE "My boyfriend's sister got married in a boat that was cruising down the Intracoastal Waterway in south Florida. During the vows, someone from a nearby unrelated boat shouted up 'DON'T DO IT! IT'S A MISTAKE!' to where we all were on the top deck. Fortunately, everyone just laughed." END

BEGIN HERE "I didn't have a traditional church wedding, but my husband's mother showed up at the courthouse to yell one last time about how I probably have STIs (because I wasn't a virgin) [and] how I'd never belong in the family (we're different races)... I haven't spoken to her since." END

Comes to exactly that part, the pause after the words are spoken and the loudest, most excruciatingly mournful howl came out of the front row. The groom's gorgeous big white husky, Shadow, was letting go of everything he had kept inside to that point. The groom tried to command him to be quiet. The dog would have none of it." END
BEGIN HERE "When the pastor got to the part 'or forever hold your peace,' the bride said, 'Yes, I'd like to say something.'

BEGIN HERE  This Reddit Thread About Horrifying Wedding Stories Is Killing Us END
BEGIN HERE Whether it's an open bar, a specialty cocktail, or a selection of your favorite beers, there's nothing guests look forward to more than hitting the bar at your wedding (aside from seeing you get married, of course!). But eventually, the party has to stop. So when's the best time to close the bar? Our experts weigh in. END
BEGIN HERE While you might think the bar should be open until your party ends, think about last call at your favorite late-night spot. If they close at 2:30, last call is usually at 2:15 at the absolute latest, giving patrons time to finish their drinks before the lights come on. The same should go for the bar at your wedding, too. If the band is ending at 11, close the bars at 10:45. This will signal to guests that the evening is about to end — and push them toward the dance floor, since they can't get a drink! This is a particularly great technique if you MUST be out of your venue by a certain time. END
BEGIN HERE Closing the bar tells guests it's time to go home, meaning you'll have fewer stragglers finishing up their last few sips of champagne when the doors are supposed to be locked. If you think your crowd might be a little slow to move, you could close the bars more than 15 minutes in advance to ensure that every drink is done and everyone is ready to go when the lights come on. END
BEGIN HERE If your venue has a less strict curfew policy, you'll still want to talk to your caterer about how late their staff can serve. If you're contracted until midnight, there's probably not much flexibility in keeping the bartenders around any later. END
BEGIN HERE Having an after-party? Make sure the bartenders know when and where it will be so that, when they do start wiping down counters and putting bottles away, they can let your guest know where to head to keep the festivities going. END

BEGIN HERE When Ben, who lived in San Francisco at the time, began searching for a place to stay in Tel Aviv in 2014, he turned to the popular tech startup Airbnb for a comfortable, homey space to call his own (at least for a little!). And the room he came upon was none other than Noa's, who just so happened to be traveling in Brazil at the time. Having his mind set on Noa's place, Ben even tried to offer some treats from his San Fran company, The Good Chocolate, as a way to persuade her into letting him stay in her home. But, what Ben didn't know was that Noa had accidentally forgotten to list the room as "unavailable" while on her Brazilian adventure. END
BEGIN HERE Feeling pretty crummy about the mix-up, Noa offered to meet with Ben for a cup of coffee while he was still in Tel Aviv (he managed to find another place to hunker down in during his stay there). And the rest they say is history! According to Apartment Therapy, "Noa learned that Ben was a calm, thoughtful, curious person who makes delicious chocolate. And Ben learned that Noa was an accomplished singer and artist who asked lots and lots of questions." END
BEGIN HERE For the next year or so the unexpected couple kept in touch nearly daily, and even visited each other several times throughout those love-filled months. Clearly smitten, it was only logical that the pair would see a wedding in their future. But because their families are from two separate parts of the world, they decided to do a civil service in San Francisco right in the Airbnb headquarters to make such a small ceremony mean a more. END

BEGIN HERE It's no secret that most Americans carry some kind of debt. But we often don't think about how those hefty bills affect anything beyond our bank accounts. It turns out that big debt such as student loans can put a big dent in our plans, including our ability to get married. END
BEGIN HERE A recent survey of U.S. adults, conducted by the Boston-based nonprofit American Student Assistance, found that 21 percent of respondents, whether male or female, are postponing marriage thanks to their seriously big school loans. And 28 percent says they are pressing pause on starting a family until they pay their debts down. "The findings indicate that despite the fact that millennials view parenthood and marriage as more of a life priority than career and financial success, many with student debt seek financial stability before marrying or beginning a family," the report states. END
BEGIN HERE The fact that so many couples would put off tying the knot while they pay down debt is no surprise to Elle Kaplan, finance expert and founder of LexION Capital. "Ultimately, plenty of marriage goals are tied to couples' finances as well as their emotions," she explains. "Just as you'd want to make sure you're on the same page about having kids, you'll want to ensure you're both eager to eliminate debt so you can afford them. What's just as important as the debt details is that partners are able to work together to pay it off." END
BEGIN HERE  Opening a New Credit Card to Pay for Your Wedding: The Pros and Cons END
BEGIN HERE If you're faced with choosing between paying down debt or paying for an engagement ring or a wedding, Kaplan encourages you to look at why you or your partner are in debt in the first place. "Is this debt is a one-time obstacle, or stemming from a behavior that will happen over and over again?" she asks. "Having student loan debt, for instance, is understandable. But if your would-be-spouse goes into credit card debt monthly at the mall, that's a major red flag." END
BEGIN HERE That being said, debt isn't necessarily a deal breaker, nor should it mean that you must automatically put off your plans to marry. "If couples can come up with a game-plan to tackle debt, it can bring them closer together and closer to their relationship goals," Kaplan says. END
BEGIN HERE Whatever you do, don't sweep your debt under the rug so that you can move forward in your relationship. "By treating debt honestly, and looking at it as something to tackle to enjoy a future together, couples can move on to doing better things with their lives," Kaplan says. END

BEGIN HERE "I am still with my husband of almost 15 years, despite my being over 90 minutes late to my own wedding! The morning of, my mother and I got into a spat over how to wear my hair. It resulted in her trying to redo it, failing miserably, and taking a long time to fix the do. This was before everyone had a cell phone and guests were starting to wonder if I had gotten cold feet. The photographer had a sense of humor: I have dozens of wedding photos featuring guests pointing at their watches and the clock in the church! My tardiness is well known amongst my family and friends!" — Cori END
BEGIN HERE "I was over an hour late to our wedding. My mother's husband (NOT my father) was driving, with my mother in the passenger seat, and me in the back. We were hopelessly lost. This was before cell phones, so there was no way to get in touch with the event place. We finally came across a phone booth, and a police officer was using it. I tried to get him to let me use the phone, explaining that I was late for my own wedding, but he didn't care and made me wait 10 minutes. Despite all this, it was a great wedding and it's been an even better marriage." — Maddy END

My mother was freaking out, 'Rachel! What are you doing! Everyone is waiting. You have to go!' but I was just so nervous. Finally my dad came around to the back seat and coaxed me out. As soon as I saw Justin I felt better and couldn't wait to walk down the aisle. My mother still jokes about how, 'Rachel wouldn't get out of the car.' " — Rachel, founder of Love Stories TV END

She stopped me in my tracks by complimenting me on my floral wedding dress and Anglo-inspired high tea hat. Mrs. Reagan was so chatty as was Mr. Griffin and so complimentary I couldn't insult their attention, albeit, by this time, I was, indeed, running late to the alter.

BEGIN HERE It takes a lot of work to pull off the perfect proposal — hours of planning, rehearsing the speech, and having to pick out a beautiful, yet affordable, engagement ring can put tons of pressure on a guy. Which is why we were SO excited when we found out famed photographer Gray Malin who we actually use for tons of beach honeymoon inspo (seriously, just take a look at his Instagram!) — is getting in on the proposal game. In the first round of his "proposal series," Malin helped two couples bring their perfect idea of a proposal to life. Here, you can read their adorable stories and see the amazing photos. END

When we moved into a one bedroom together, it came along too and had a prominent place on our wall. Becky and Gray actually started to work together on a few projects and she adored him. She always mentioned their projects to me and how much she loved working with him, so I reached out to Gray to create the most special surprise and to be an important part of our engagement." END
BEGIN HERE      Photo:     END
BEGIN HERE As for getting a picture of Becky from above (for the "MARRY ME" photo in Washington Square Park Gray would create), things proved more difficult. "It was easy to photograph me on a knee. I went home and had my dad take a picture of me from above on a balcony while I was across the street. But photographing Becky was hard. How do you take a good, clear picture of your girlfriend from several stories up without giving it away or feeling like a complete pervert? Not easy. So naturally, I decided the best idea was to get Becky drunk. There was one snowstorm that seemed like a good excuse, but the lighting and the depth were off. A few weeks later, I took her to brunch and then we walked along the High Line. I told her I was feeling 'artsy' and asked her to stand below the High Line so I could take pictures from above. That should have been a red flag, but she didn't oppose. Mission accomplished." END
BEGIN HERE And Becky's reaction to this well-thought out proposal? "I was incredibly surprised and impressed! He thought about every single detail and crafted such a special proposal. We have always loved Washington Square Park — we live two blocks north and spend a lot of time there so it was very meaningful that he asked me to marry him in the park. I didn't know at the time that there was one more surprise, which of course, was Gray's beautiful photograph." END
BEGIN HERE "After the initial shock wore off, Jesse told me he had one more surprise, which I would get that evening. I had no idea what he had planned. When I got to the bar and saw the photo, I was overwhelmed with love. It is, by far, the most thoughtful gift I have ever received and I can only image the amount of time and effort that went into creating such an incredible piece of art. Before I knew Gray, I loved his work and then when I got to know him, I absolutely adored him, so his involvement in our engagement means the world to me." END

However, sometimes it feels like no one told guests that, and they start picking gifts they think the couple will love — even with a perfectly good registry easily accessible on the bride and groom's wedding website.

BEGIN HERE Have you ever seen a groom wear a kilt on the beach? Neither had we, until now. When Stephanie and Andrew got engaged in Cabo San Lucas, two years after they met at a tech conference in Las Vegas, they knew exactly where they would say "I do": On the beach in Sayulita, Mexico. "My family has been spending the holidays there since I was a child, and Andrew fell in love with it during his first visit. Thank goodness, since he didn't actually visit Sayulita until after we'd sent out our save the dates!" says Stephanie. For their May 9, 2015, wedding, the couple booked a private residence, Villa del Oso, as the setting for their 125-person bash. The beachfront estate, with stunning sunset views, was the perfect place for their sunny celebration! END
BEGIN HERE Stephanie and Andrew pulled out all the stops for their big day, serving amazing local food and flying in a DJ from the U.S. to keep the dance party going all night long — with a few surprises tossed in for good measure. And of course, the Scottish groom made his grand entrance in a kilt! Take a look at this colorful Mexican celebration, photographed by Ryan Flynn Photography, below! END

And while we loved seeing Refaeli's bare baby bump selfies, we have a feeling her little one is even more adorable than those belly baring pics! END
BEGIN HERE Refaeli rang in the New Year with some super exciting news, as she announced that she was pregnant with her first child. Refaeli first shared her mom-to-be status with her Instagram followers in early January, posting a pic of her positive pregnancy test. "2016 is going to be like..." the 31-year-old model captioned the photo, including the baby and bottle emojis that her year was bound to be full of. And now, that baby and bottle have finally arrived! END

The model reportedly gave birth at the Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv, Israel, where the proud parents named their daughter Liv. Simple, short, sweet, and so cute! How could we not love it? END
BEGIN HERE "I think this will be a decade of family," Refaeli previously said, sharing her plans for more children in the future. "I come from a family of four children... A lot of [moms] could read this and think, 'Yeah, try having one first.' Hopefully, I'll have a big family, but I'll take it one by one." END

In a slew of social media photos, we've seen Refaeli showing off her tummy in itty bitty bikinis. (What else would you expect a Sports Illustrated star wear?) "You can come out now ... I'm ready.

END
BEGIN HERE   An heirloom brooch is a no brainer, of course, but what about something like a family watch, bracelet, necklace or even a rosary, recommends Chancey Charm Richmond wedding planner Alana Futcher. "Wrapping your bouquet is always a good sentiment and you can use anything to do so," she notes. "Also, as heirlooms often include pieces of jewelry, while you use the original heirloom you can have your girls wear cloned pieces that look just like it!" END

BEGIN HERE If you're planning to do a rain dance or bury a bottle of bourbon to try to deter even a single drop from falling on your wedding day, pause to read these brides stories and you might find you want to pack a poncho instead. END
BEGIN HERE "My mother-in-law, ever the planner, checked the weather forecast for our wedding day several days in advance. Once she saw there was a chance of rain, she picked up matching black umbrellas for everyone in the wedding party to have on hand. And when our photographer saw all of us with our umbrellas arriving at our house, the scene of our post-ceremony photos, it gave her an idea. She instructed us to hold up the matching black umbrellas on the front porch of our 1920's Tudor-style home. The result was one of my favorite photos from the entire wedding: The bridesmaids were all dressed in black dresses, the groomsmen in black suits, me in my white gown, my husband in his black tuxedo and everyone was smiling through the rain while holding our black umbrellas. It's a stunning black-and-white photo that captures the timelessness we were going for in our wedding decor and photos, and the element of fun we incorporated throughout the big day." — Lauren  END
BEGIN HERE "It poured on our wedding day. Our picture session got cut drastically short as everyone was getting soaked and we were all freezing. I got my dress muddy, and I ruined my hair running from the church to the limo after the ceremony. We had a BBQ dinner planned, as our venue had a huge patio — for which I had painstakingly planned the decor. Needless to say, the patio was closed completely for the duration of the reception, and the BBQ turned into a strange makeshift buffet set up in the venue. And the ambience was somewhat detracted from with the huge yellow 'wet floor' signs everywhere. But rain didn't ruin our day. The thunderstorm was atmospheric in our reception venue, which featured glass walls, and it also made everything dark and cozy, which complemented the candlelight inside. The photos? END
BEGIN HERE   Well, I didn't get many of the outdoor nature shots I'd hoped for, but our photographer captured some awesome candid shots of us all huddled in the limo, the girls wrapped in the men's' damp jackets, drinking champagne and laughing. And best of all, the rain kept everyone together. The dance floor was packed and everyone socialized in the reception area, while on a sunny evening, they would have been scattered around the patio and venue gardens." — Christina END
BEGIN HERE "We were married in September on an island off the coast of Maine. It was an outdoor ceremony and the week leading up to our nuptials was perfect: clear skies, high 70s, and no chance of rain. The morning before our wedding, it was beautiful out. It wasn't until I was dressed and ready to go that the skies started to darken. The rain held out until we said, 'I do.' Moments later, it started to drizzle and we all moved under the tent. Thankfully we had one. Like all true island weddings in Maine, however, the ground was just grass so as the rain started to pour, everyone kicked off their wedding shoes and danced in the mud. Our photos were absolutely gorgeous. In the background you can see huge clouds rolling in and the sky darkening. I don't think our photos would have been half as magical had there been clear skies. And while my wedding dress got stained all across the hem with mud, I didn't get upset. I kicked off my sandals and danced in it. Afterward, I never got my dress professionally cleaned. Now every time I see that mud stain on the bottom, I'm reminded of how beautiful that day was. I'm also reminded that sometimes when things go wrong in life, it's best to just embrace the storm and ride it out. Something amazing can come out of it." — Laura END
BEGIN HERE "I was married two years ago in what can only be described as a monsoon in Florida. Our wedding was all outdoors; we were promised the venue had never had a wash out. Well, we set the record. It rained sideways for hours. The venue was flooded up to the mid-calf level. The cake was sitting in an un-air conditioned garage — which doubled as the groom's quarters — sweating. But somehow the rain only delayed our wedding 30 minutes. I told my bridesmaids to bustle me up — the rain was over, but the mud was there to stay — and to get everyone in line. Our friends and family scrabbled to get the chairs dry and the decorations out. A few items had to be ditched, but no one noticed. I was never once anxious, which isn't like me at all. All I can remember is my groom telling me no matter what he would marry me. And we did — we got married. Because of the storm, the sunset was so stunning it made our photos magical. You would never know it was the wedding that almost wasn't. The real kicker is my new sisters-in-law carrying the sweating cake to its home through a gate and winding path and a tiny wooden bridge. It was the most magical day of my life." — Michelle END
BEGIN HERE  6 Ways to Prepare for Rain on Wedding Day END
BEGIN HERE "My husband and I chose our wedding venue because of all the outdoor photo-ops. A barn, lake and an apple orchard sealed the deal. We planned our ceremony in the apple orchard. I had ornate vintage details like gold frames and paper fans ready to hang on trees. We had a special arch made out of branches for the alter. And we splurged for a hot apple cider station to warm up guests on our fall morning affair. Then, it rained and everything was wet. We could have still held the wedding outside, but I didn't want our hair to get frizzy. So we moved it inside and actually scored big. Our guests were going to stand outside for our quick vow exchange since the venue charged an absurd amount for chairs. But inside, the chairs we free! And I got great photos using pretty white umbrellas as photo props." — Joelle END
BEGIN HERE "We had a backyard wedding at my best friend's home outside of Chicago. It was in the 80s and humid, and right as we said our vows, the ominous clouds erupted into thunder. We all kind of giggled — small wedding, 60-some guests. As we walked down the aisle as man and wife, it started to sprinkle, then it rained harder. Everyone scrambled to the tent where the reception was to be held. It only rained for about 20 minutes, and then a gorgeous rainbow came out, the temperature dropped ,and humidity broke. It was like God orchestrated the timing on the whole thing. And I have the pictures to prove it." — Susan END
BEGIN HERE "There were multiple road and bridge closures in the area that affected our guests' ability to get to the church on time. Then, our reception hall's basement flooded, knocking out the facility's furnace. So, we had an unheated reception in Illinois in February. Our guests wore winter coats over their finery while eating. And after the reception, on the way to our wedding night accommodations, we navigated flooded roads in an unrelenting rain storm. But rain did not ruin our wedding day. The goal of a wedding is to get married — and that was accomplished. As long as the bride, groom, and officiant show up, isn't that what matters? Plus, my husband and I were both old enough at the time of our wedding to know there is no such thing as a perfect day. Things happen. Weather happens. Wardrobe malfunctions happen. Events don't always go according to plan. You just roll with whatever life throws you and consider it an adventure." — Leigh  END
BEGIN HERE "Having in August wedding in Florida meant a few sprinkles as the ceremony ended. Several guests had walked from the hotel to the ceremony, so I felt terrible that my guests would get wet! It was a struggle for me and my new husband to get into our limo without getting soaked. But, this was the perfect occasion for the guys attending to show how great of gentlemen they were. They held doors and helped people in and out of cars as we went from the ceremony at a local church to the reception at the hotel. The rain actually helped cool the temperature too." — Theresa END

Not only is Bailon newly engaged after her beau Israel Houghton popped the question, but the groom-to-be got down on one knee in one of the world's most picturesque locales — the Eiffel Tower! Could the moment possibly get anymore romantic? As it turns out, yes it can, thanks to a mega-watt engagement ring whose sparkle could compete with that of the City of Lights. END
BEGIN HERE The Real star took to social media to announce her and Houghton's happy news by posting a très belle engagement ring selfie and a few other celebratory shots (see below) during their Parisian getaway. "You. Me. Oui," Bailon captioned an Instagram video of her super sparkler glittering in front of the Eiffel Tower. And guys, that rock is HUGE. Even the Eiffel Tower couldn't compete with the beauty of Bailon's emerald-cut ring and its haute halo. END
BEGIN HERE According to Entertainment Tonight, Bailon — who was previously linked to music executive Lenny Santiango and formerly dated Rob Kardashian — and Houghton originally jetted to Paris to celebrate the 19th anniversary of the bride-to-be's parents. But apparently the Grammy-winning Christian musician had some tricks — and a ring! — up his sleeve. After popping the question, he took to his own Instagram page to write a sweet spiel about his to-be wife. END
BEGIN HERE "I have seen and felt the essence of Gods grace through the life, the kindness and the courage of this woman," Houghton began. "I've seen her attacked, lied about, wrongfully accused, mocked, laughed at, and misunderstood. But, I've also seen the shining example of the eagle she is that rises above the cacophony of the noise of ignorants — I'm learning from her example." END
BEGIN HERE "I've taken a giant leap of faith in asking her to share life with me forever and to give me a shot at getting it right this time," the gospel singer continued.

Phelps' fiancé Nicole Johnson just spilled her and Phelps' wedding day details and the big day sounds like it'll be a splash! (Get it? Splash? Swimming? We'll show ourselves out...) END
BEGIN HERE In between cheering on our favorite athletes, we've been spending the Rio de Janeiro Olympics positively swooning over the sheer adorableness of Phelps' little family. Nicole Johnson and her and Phelps' baby boy, Boomer, may have stolen the title as the Olympics' cutest cheering section, but as it turns out, it took the Olympian and beauty queen awhile to get where they are today. The pair had originally started dating in 2007 before ending their relationship four years later. "I'm pretty sure we both shared stuff with our parents and were like, 'Oh, this is it, there's no way we are getting back together,'" Johnson recently shared with Access Hollywood. "And then when we finally did, it was still a little rocky and figuring things out, figuring each other out because it had been some time. But we didn't miss a beat." END
BEGIN HERE In 2014, the two were officially a couple again with Phelps later popping the question to Johnson in February 2015. And this bride-to-be already has her mother-in-law's stamp of approval. "When he called me, and he said 'I'm getting back with Nicole,' I said, 'That's where you should be.' And so he said 'I'm determined to make this happen,'" remembers Debbie Phelps. And happening it is! The wedding is on and coming up fast, and the bride is finally opening up on those big day details. END
BEGIN HERE "We have a date," Johnson began, stating that the destination wedding will take place at the end of the year. "It'll be small and intimate for the wedding and then we're throwing a massive bash for everyone in the States. So we're kind of getting things rolling. I've been planning as we've been leading up to [the Olympics] so I think I have the wedding in order, and now it's onto the party." END

The big day took place at the gorgeous Vibiana in Los Angeles, where Princess Love walked down the aisle in a glitzy and glam Lazaro ballgown which she accessorized with a beaded headpiece. Meanwhile, Ray J donned a traditional black suit jazzed up with a regal chain draped around this chest. END
BEGIN HERE If the couple's wedding day style wasn't enough to impress, their star-studded bridal party will sure do the trick.

BEGIN HERE At the reception, the bride changed into a slinky, curve-hugging second wedding dress before Brandy performed "At Last" for her brother and new sister-in-law's first dance. Afterwards, guests dined on a towering eight tiered wedding cake. Yes, eight! Now that's our kind of fairytale... END
BEGIN HERE "I just want her to have the time of her life and remember it as the best day in the world," Ray J said ahead of the big day. "Even when I wasn't with her, I told my friends 'She the one, she the one.' It was just something about how I felt when she was around me." And the bride sounds just as head-over-heels with her new hubby. "He's the only person I've ever been with that I couldn't see myself without," said Princess Love. END

BEGIN HERE Cash wedding registries can be a total boon for the couple who already has everything they need to create their home together. Sure, upgrading is nice, but if you love your dishes and couldn't possibly fit another kitchen appliance in your cabinets, extra money toward your honeymoon or home-improvement projects will be just as appreciated — and won't take up any space. But for pre-wedding parties like your bridal shower, when guests traditionally arrive with either kitchenwares or lingerie, is creating an actual registry required? Here's what our experts have to say. END
BEGIN HERE While you probably have a really good reason for skipping the traditional registry in the first place (we hear you, newlywed kitchens are SMALL!), when it comes to your bridal shower, putting together an abridged registry is a good idea. After all, guests will want to arrive with a gift in hand and save the check for your wedding day, and a registry makes that process much easier. Take a good look at your inventory, and opt for items that you really could use, even if you don't need them. Remember items like towels, sheets, and other soft goods — they might need an update, or could be great items to have an extra set of on-hand. END
BEGIN HERE Another great idea is to ask your bridal shower hostesses to choose a more specific theme so guests can get you more creative gifts. Do you love to cook? Create a list of cookbooks you'd love to have (our list of must-have titles is a great place to start!), whether it's every single aspect of Italian cooking or a variety of publications from around the globe. Are the two of you big wine drinkers? Invite your friends to bring their favorite bottle so you can have a wine-tasting night. Love getting everyone together for Game Night? A collection of board games will keep the fun going. END
BEGIN HERE  Do All Bridal Showers Need a Theme? END
BEGIN HERE You spent a lot of time planning your wedding day. So it's only reasonable that you want to actually enjoy it — especially in the moment. But stress and worry can take precedence over enjoying the fruits of your labor, warns Jaclyn Fisher, owner of Two Little Birds Planning, if you're not careful to stay present. END
BEGIN HERE   "At the end of the day, the most important part of a wedding is the celebration of your love and beginning of your life together," she says. "Brides need to remember that when they start to get distracted and stressed. If they don't stay present, their wedding day will go by in a flash without the bride actually experiencing or enjoying it." END
BEGIN HERE With that in mind, here are seven expert-approved tips to help you stay in the moment. END
BEGIN HERE   If you really want to relax on your wedding day, then you must trust the team you've put in place to execute it. "Bringing on vendors that are reliable, experienced and talented will remove so much of the worry about what's happening behind the scenes," Nichols explains. "Your wedding planner will be handling all of the details and logistics of the wedding day with your vendors. This will allow you to walk into the ceremony and reception knowing that everything and everyone are in their place and ready to have a good time." END
BEGIN HERE There's nothing we love more than a wedding reception space that makes your family and friends feel right at home. To create a space that's as comfy and cozy as your own living room (or scratch that...a living room in your favorite interior design magazine) we asked a few decorating pros to share their top tips. END
BEGIN HERE   Fabric has the ability to completely transform a space and make a large room feel more warm and cozy, notes Kohler. "At my wedding, for example, we tented the entire space and had the cocktail room separated from the reception by a large drape lined with florals. This made for a grand entrance as well as way to divide the two large rooms in a beautiful and soft way." Consider using soft textures for all your fabric options, including the lounge furniture you rent (think velvet and suede over leather) and your table linens too. END
BEGIN HERE Last-minute cancellations for your wedding are tough. From the meal count to the seating chart, finding out someone can't attend your wedding after you've put in the work can be frustrating! It can be particularly sad if the person who can't make it is a bridesmaid, groomsmen, or other member of your wedding party. So what's a couple to do if their ranks are a little smaller come wedding day? Here are a few tips from our experts. END
BEGIN HERE There are a few logistical items you should take care of ASAP if you'll have one fewer member of your wedding party. First, get in touch with your vendors to make any necessary changes that will impact your budget. Whether it's one less bouquet or boutonniere, canceling a hair appointment, or simply removing a chair and meal from your head table, these are all items that you probably haven't paid for yet, so you should be able to recoup some costs. Second, have your bridesmaid or groomsmen see which of their own arrangements they can cancel. Is the groomsman renting a suit? See if he can get at least a partial refund. Bridesmaid renting a hotel room or a car for the weekend? She should be able to get some of her money back. While flights are hard to cancel, they may be able to retain some of the fee as a credit toward future travel. END
BEGIN HERE Then, of course, there are the items that are a little harder to change. Don't worry about having your ceremony programs reprinted. Chances are most guests won't notice that there was one fewer groomsman heading down the aisle, and those that know someone's not present will probably already know he or she wasn't able to make it. You may need to double up on the processional, with one groomsman escorting two bridesmaids or a groomsman walking alone, but non-traditional processionals are totally ok! END
BEGIN HERE And lastly, you should still pop that bridesmaid or groomsman gift in the mail, along with a note and a few pictures from your big day. Even if they weren't able to be there to celebrate with you, this is a sweet way to let them know you missed them, and to share a little piece of your celebration. END
BEGIN HERE  The 3 Things a Bride Can't Ask Her Bridesmaids to Do END
BEGIN HERE Let's face it: Writing thank you notes gets a very bad rap as being utterly boring. Why? "Because," says Diane Gottsman, etiquette expert and owner of The Protocol School of Texas, "most of the time it is boring." But it doesn't have to be. Here, with Gottsman's tips, it can actually be an enjoyable and efficient experience. (Seriously!) END
BEGIN HERE   One reason thank you note writing might not be fun is if you worry about writing the perfect words. "Your thank you note does not have to be a novel," Gottsman says. "Knowing what to write and understanding how to do it efficiently takes the dread out of the gesture. Just make sure and hit these marks: use their name, thank them for the gift, mentioning specifically what they gave you and how you plan to use it or enjoy it, and close with a desire to connect in the future."

BEGIN HERE As this bridal fashion week comes to close, leaving us with visions of luxurious layers of tulle and lace dancing in our heads, we're taking a look back on one of our favorite collections this season — Marchesa's Spring 2017 collection. We just couldn't help ourselves! (Could you really blame us, though? Have you seen those bridal masterpieces?) But we're not just taking a quick second gander at all of Marchesa's gorgeous wedding dresses. We've got an exclusive, in-depth video where our fashion editor, Elle Strauss, got to chat with the two lovely ladies behind the fashion powerhouse, Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig, where they revealed their thoughts behind their stunning new collection. END
BEGIN HERE Full of unrivaled decadence and romanticism, Marchesa's Spring 2017 wedding dresses are a "journey through a real, enchanted garden," according to the detail-orientated designers who infused 3-D florals and pale blush hues into airy gowns for a collection that's flourishing with a springtime garden theme. Hand-cut rose petals look freshly-plucked on tulle ball gown skirts, while crystals and pearls (a nod to morning mist) delicately adorn the bodices. Could you just?! END
BEGIN HERE So what kind of bride did Chapman and Craig have in mind as this collection began to blossom? Simply put, practically all to-be-wed ladies! "Every bride could be a Marchesa bride," Craig told us, thanks to a collection full of wedding day wares fit for everything from a seaside ceremony to more traditional "I do's." END
BEGIN HERE As for one of the most striking pieces of Marchesa's Spring 2017 collection — the jaw-dropping jewels adorning décolletages and framing faces — Chapman and Craig offered up some styling tips for when it comes to bridal baubles. Many of the dresses within the collection are accessorized with big, statement earrings (some even crafted out of fresh flowers!) and long, luxe necklaces. "If you want to make a statement on your wedding day, you can go for that," suggests Craig. However, the designers are also huge fans of smaller chic crawlers as a slightly-daintier big day accessory. END
BEGIN HERE  Spring 2017 Wedding Dress Trends END
BEGIN HERE At the end of the day, Marchesa has something for everyone — from "the bride that perhaps want to be a little more fahsion-forward" to someone "who wants to make a statement with her jewelry and go simpler on the dress." END
BEGIN HERE "The modern bride has a lot of options now," notes Chapman. "Which I think is so exciting." END
BEGIN HERE We couldn't agree more! END
BEGIN HERE It's commonly said that rain on your wedding day is good luck. Whether or not that's an ancient myth or a true statement, it's always a good idea to have a rain back-up plan in place, especially if parts of your wedding are outdoors. So when you're planning your big day, here are six different ways to prepare a rain-day wedding back-up plan. END
BEGIN HERE   In the end, it's just rain. But it's also still your wedding day. Try to make the most of it and stay positive, that way you can pass that attitude onto your guests and still enjoy your special day. END

BEGIN HERE Here at BRIDES, we've seen our fair share of out-of-the-box marriage proposals — from incorporating the furriest of friends to recreating the scenery of favorite T.V. shows to practically scaring a fiancé into saying yes with a set-up right out of a horror movie. But in the game of creative marriage proposals, this one wins the Quidditch Cup. A pair of Harry Potter fanatics just got engaged, but just how does a wannabe wizard pop the question? Well, with a proposal that would definitely get J.K. Rowling's stamp of approval. Evan Onuskanych of Pennsylvania played upon his girlfriend's Harry Potter-loving heart with a customized Marauder's Map that told their entire love story. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Giphy    END
BEGIN HERE For those of you in need of a Hogwarts refresher course, the Marauder's Map was a magical document that showed every nook, cranny, and hidden passageway of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry — as well as the location of everyone on the grounds. And for Evan, it was the perfect way to pop the question to his girlfriend of five years, Kelsey Davis. END
BEGIN HERE "I was thinking of different ways of proposing that were particularly unique to our relationship," Evan told Buzzfeed of how he came up with the concept. Knowing his girlfriend's love for the series, a Harry Potter-themed proposal seemed like the perfect plan. "I used a template based off the original Marauder's Map for the covers, but went custom from there. I wanted to make sure we were located on the map exactly in the spot I would propose." END
BEGIN HERE Marauders Map Proposal END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Kelsey Davis via Facebook    END
BEGIN HERE From where they met (Spring Ford High School) to their common alma mater (Penn State), Evan drew up the location on the personalized Marauder's Map so it would tell the story of their relationship. "I broke it up into four major parts of our lives — where we met, our first memories, college, and the present," Evan explained. The most meaningful locale of all? The spot where Kelsey ended up saying yes! END
BEGIN HERE To pop the question, this creative groom-to-be took Kelsey to a favorite hiking trail of theirs that they've nicknamed, "The Beach," and made sure to include it on the map, with their little footprints standing side-by-side. "She cried... a lot," he told Bustle. "She was shocked and extremely happy. She just kept saying 'is this for real?'" remembers Evan. END
BEGIN HERE And if you're wondering how these two Potterheads plan to say "I do," they've got some ideas. According to the groom, he's hoping for a wedding filled with "small, subtle hints" of the franchise thrown in here and there. But as for the bride... "If she had her way, the whole thing would be Harry Potter themed," says Evan. END

BEGIN HERE It seems like just yesterday that we were freaking out over the news of Nikki Reed and Ian Somerhalder's California wedding — her lace wedding dress, the gorgeous bohemian backdrop, the groom's absurdly handsome face... See? We're still obsessed. (Luckily the couple shared their wedding photos with us exclusively, so we can stare at them anytime.) But, turns out, this beautiful couple's one-year anniversary is coming up! As of April 26, Somerhalder and Reed will have been husband and wife for a full year. So, natch, we're anxious to hear when we can be expecting some ridiculously good-looking children from this duo. And Reed is finally shedding some light on the topic, as well as opening up about married life in general. END
BEGIN HERE "Our household is very busy all the time," she told E! News at the Kiehl's Earth Day event. "No boring conversations at dinner." END
BEGIN HERE Lucky for us, E! also took this opportunity to ask the former Twilight actress about her and her husband's plans for children. When asked about the possibility of them having little ones later on, Reed said "I'm sure that's in the cards." END
BEGIN HERE Way to have a poker face, Nikki! Conversely, her adorable other half seems to be slightly more open about the topic. Somerhalder revealed back in September that he can't wait to have kids with his new wife. "Oh, hell yes! Absolutely," the Vampire Diaries actor excitedly shared when asked if he wants to be a dad. "It's a pretty crazy time and place to bring a child into this turbulent and insane world — but I really can't wait to do it and really just love it... I'm actually pregnant right now!" he joked. END
BEGIN HERE While Somerhalder himself was obviously not with child, the newlyweds are keeping busy trying! "You know, it's all about practice," he went on about their steamy relationship. "It's not practice makes perfect — it's perfect practice!" END
BEGIN HERE And with all the celebrity baby news buzzing around Hollywood, we can hardly keep up! Chrissy Teigen and John Legend debuted their adorable daughter Luna Simone on social media this week, Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds announced they're expecting their second bundle of joy, Adam Levine and Behati Prinsloo keep showing off her barely-there baby bump... We totally wouldn't be surprised if Somerhalder and Reed announced that they were expecting sometime soon. In the meantime though, we'll just be stealing inspiration from their dreamy California wedding. END
BEGIN HERE They say good things happen in threes, and starting a life together might be the impetus you needed to upgrade your digs to a bigger apartment or to sign on the dotted line and buy a house. Congratulations! Hopefully you've timed it so you're not packing up the morning of your rehearsal, but if you're moving around the same time as your wedding date, you'll have more than just your regular stuff to deal with: You'll also have a house full of wedding gifts! So can you make it easy on yourselves and ask guests to hold off on sending gifts until after your move is complete? Here's what our experts have to say. END
BEGIN HERE While you can't give guests directions about when to order your wedding gift to ensure it arrives after you've moved, you do have a few options that can help ease the process. END
BEGIN HERE The first is to follow registry tradition and have your gifts sent to your parents' home. If they live relatively nearby and have space to store things, this will allow guests to send gifts when it's convenient, as well as ensure everything is collected in one place. Just be sure to stop by when a new gift arrives so you can open it, keep track of who sent it, and get working on those thank you notes! END
BEGIN HERE  5 Tips for Navigating Wedding Registries in 2015 (Your Parents Will Want to Read This!) END
BEGIN HERE The second is to register on a website that allows you to choose when gifts are sent to you, like Zola. They'll notify you when a gift has been purchased (and track who bought it!) so you can send thank you notes ahead of time, but you can opt to have them hold on to the boxes and ship them when it's convenient for you. END
BEGIN HERE The last option is to have gifts shipped to your office or another address that won't be changing in the near future. It's not ideal, but it will save you the stress of wondering whether gifts will be returned to the sender before you can update your registry with your new address. END
BEGIN HERE There's no better way to express your gratitude to your bridesmaids than with a thoughtful gift and, thanks to Etsy, you don't have to look far. Etsy curates tons of gifts for bridesmaids — there are SO many options for you to give to your girls as a way to say thank you for everything.

BEGIN HERE When Nasim and Tripp started planning their wedding, they really wanted to elope. "We got engaged in Big Sur during a road trip down the Pacific Coast Highway, and we thought we'd just go back with our families and get married there," Nasim says. But they realized there were so many more people they wanted to involve, so a big wedding it was (with 200 guests!). But that doesn't mean it was a traditional party. Instead, they chose to celebrate at the Decatur House in Washington, D.C., on New Year's Eve of 2014, turning their wedding into a glitzy celebration that was more about the party, even though Nasim was wearing white. END

But, it turns out, while we were busy reminiscing on the days of The Parent Trap, Mean Girls and, yes, even Freaky Friday, Lohan was falling in love with — and possibly getting engaged to — none other than Egor Tarabasov, the 22-year-old son of a Russian millionaire.

BEGIN HERE When your new husband is a package deal, it can be a challenge to get the kids to accept you. Here is how some enterprising new brides managed that feat. END
BEGIN HERE "It took time. When I started dating their father, I took an active interest in them as people. I asked about their hobbies, sports, and interests... I played badminton with my stepson. I even taught him how to hit a softball. Because I was genuine and authentic, he responded back in kind." —Gloria END
BEGIN HERE "I knew it would be difficult for Sam's kids to accept their dad was remarrying. They acted out and pushed me away for months and months, but I stayed caring and friendly and let them know I could never replace their mom. Eventually they came around. The key was I knew their resistance wasn't about me but due to a dramatic, unlooked for change in their lives." —Kim END
BEGIN HERE "I have two stepsons —13 and 17. First time I met them, I said, 'Hi, I'm Lisa. Wanna go ride go-carts?' After riding go-carts, we played skeeball. Neither boy had seen an adult take skeeball so seriously so they asked where I got my throwing skills. I told them I played massive skeeball when I was unemployed. Won gift certificates for free pizza and that how I ate during said period of unemployment. They didn't know grownups did such a thing so this led to them asking questions about me and how their dad and I met, etc. The youngest told me I was the coolest grown up he'd ever met." —Lisa END
BEGIN HERE "I didn't want my husband's daughter to feel I was monopolizing her dad so I gave them plenty of time alone. That made her feel less threatened and helped ease the way to her accepting me more readily." —Jill END
BEGIN HERE "I didn't pretend to be someone I wasn't. I admitted that since I didn't have children I was inexperienced at what they enjoyed but I was eager to learn. Having me admit flaws, that I didn't consider myself perfect, seemed to help calm their concerns." —Sheila END
BEGIN HERE "When Charlie's daughter visited he and I were a united front at enforcing rules and boundaries. Sharyn needed to respect that she couldn't manipulate me." —Ellyn END
BEGIN HERE "I started small. My goal was to have one good interaction with my stepson a day. Then two, then three. It's been a bit of an uphill battle but Joey is starting to realize I care about him as a person in his own right." —Babs END
BEGIN HERE "At first when Bill and his kids talked about things they'd done together in the past, I felt left out. But I came to realize that the better tactic was not to feel excluded from their rich, shared history but for us to start making memories ourselves. Now we have Sunday pancakes and hot chocolate mornings to look forward to, and many laugh-filled adventures of our own to reminisce about." —Tara END

BEGIN HERE When it comes to wedding planning, it's a big time investment — for usually over a year. Many brides consider it a full-time side job! And because Julianne Hough, who recently got engaged to Canadian hockey player Brooks Laich, has had quite the hectic last few years — from starring in Fox-TV's 2016 production of Grease: Live! and Footloose to being a two-time professional champion on Dancing With the Stars, she's taking her wedding planning very slowly. END
BEGIN HERE For the first time in her life, the triple-threat actress/singer/dancer is free of any contracts — allowing her to finally focus on the biggest contract in her life: her marriage! When discussing her upcoming nuptials with Refinery29, Hough shared that she and her fiancé don't even have a wedding date yet, and they're not worried about it. "We're not great planners," she revealed, "we're really just enjoying our engagement period, because we're never going to be here again." END
BEGIN HERE "Even when we were dating, we were like, 'Let's just be boyfriend and girlfriend.' And now that we're engaged, it's 'let's just be fiancés,'" Hough said. "When we get married, we'll be husband and wife. And then, we'll be mom and dad. We just want to enjoy each stage of our relationship." END
BEGIN HERE Hough and her hockey player beau have been dating since 2013, and the pair got engaged last August. Laich proposed in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, where Hough's grandparents live, with a gorgeous stunner of a diamond engagement ring. END
BEGIN HERE Even though she's not sure of when the big day is going down, Hough is certain about a few things, including that the event will take place outdoors. "We both want to keep it as intimate as possible — that's just more our style and our vibe." That may be tough, however, because the former Dancing With the Stars actress shared that her family is huge. "I have a very big family, so intimate to us might be big to some people." END
BEGIN HERE And speaking of big, there's probably a little pressure to perform when it comes to the first-dance department. As a former Dancing With the Stars judge, we're sure that she'll be planning something special. END

This is what a fashion-loving woman wears to her rehearsal dinner — a truly one-of-a-kind piece that will have all eyes on her and that will look smashing in photos. END
BEGIN HERE Say it ain't so! We might have to return the outfits we've already picked out for the big day (still waiting on that invite, you guys...), because the wedding of Robert Pattinson and FKA Twigs might not ever come to be! The news just broke that their upcoming nuptials have allegedly been canceled by the groom and our hearts are totally breaking for the former Twilight star and the British artist. END
BEGIN HERE According to In Touch Weekly, Pattinson has called off their "I do's," which were set to take place this coming summer. "It's been a long time coming," a source close to the couple shared with the tabloid. "They were fighting all the time." END
BEGIN HERE Why all the arguing? Well, the source claims that it's due to the fact that all the wedding planning didn't exactly bring out the best in either the bride or groom. (Trust us, it happens...) The source stated that the planning process was a "major drag" for Pattinson — ahem, when is it not for the groom? — and led to the British actor feeling rather trapped in the relationship. END
BEGIN HERE "[She] isn't the girl for him," the source also added, regarding FKA Twigs. "She's very jealous and he was sick of having to explain himself." END
BEGIN HERE But apparently it sounds like what it all came down to was a classic case of cold feet. "He's still young," the source concluded. "And just decided he wasn't ready to settle down." END
BEGIN HERE We're not giving up hope for these two just yet! Back in August, Pattinson and FKA Twigs pushed back their wedding date to give themselves more time to pull the big day together, so we have our fingers crossed that this "I do" holdup is just another postponement and not actually a break-up. And who knows? You can't believe everything you read in the tabloids, can you? For all we know, they could be off at a cake tasting at this very moment! Well, we can only hope... END

BEGIN HERE   Vineyard nuptials are all about the wine, and Kawania Wooten of Howerton+Wooten Events, worked with a couple who had guests sign a collection of bottles with customized labels. The labels indicated the couple's first, fifth, tenth, and twentieth anniversaries so they could enjoy each bottle on the special occasion. END
BEGIN HERE As a bride, you'll find yourself turning to your maid of honor for so many things during the wedding adventure. She'll easily become your right-hand gal-pal, there for you when you're on the edge of a pre-wedding panic attack or in the middle of making a tough wedding decision, like what kind of flowers you should put in the bouquet or what color the bridesmaid dresses should be. You'll even put your faith in her to plan your bachelorette party or possibly your bridal shower. END
BEGIN HERE But one of the very last and final tasks your maid-of-honor will do for you is give a toast on your wedding day, in front of your family and friends. So what can you do to ensure that the speech won't embarrass you or include too many details about that "Spring Break trip that must not be mentioned" you took many years ago? END
BEGIN HERE You want to give your maid of honor freedom and not be too much of a micro-manager when she's writing it, but at the same time, you want to remind her who the audience is. It's best if you casually mention to her that she should keep the reception speech PG. If she wants to talk about embarrassing stories or even ex-boyfriends, the time and place to do that is on the bachelorette party. END
BEGIN HERE If you're still a little worried about what she's going to say, have another close friend give it a read beforehand. That way, it's still a surprise to you on the day of the wedding. Just not a surprise that will make your cheeks flush or potentially sour your entire day. END

BEGIN HERE Most brides nowadays plan their weddings by staring at a computer screen. Scanning Pinterest. Emailing vendors. Reading wedding blogs. (Gotcha!) You gain a lot by going it alone like this. Creative control. Fun. Efficiency. No guilt about burdening others. By being the sole gatekeeper of information, communication, relationships with vendors, and deadlines, you're eliminating the risk of massive screw-ups. You've got this wedding thing covered. END
BEGIN HERE But you may also be starting to feel overworked and lonely. Resentment's building — at your fiancé, at your family, at your girlfriends — for not understanding just how much work this is. So you have to decide: Are you willing to take the risk of allowing others into your wedding planning process? END
BEGIN HERE Because if you assign, say, welcome bags to your mom and your aunts, the likelihood is that something won't be quite right on the day you meet to stuff them. Your mom couldn't quite find all the items you wanted — so she picked up others she thought were better (but in fact are so not you). The bags your aunties purchased are slightly too big and don't quite match your color scheme. And so on. END
BEGIN HERE Yep, that's how it goes when you let people help you. You lose complete control. But if you can get over your short-term annoyance that the welcome bags aren't turning out exactly as you envisioned, you can gain so much from sharing this experience, such as... END

BEGIN HERE After watching countless proposal videos — and even one that lead to some misdemeanor charges being filed — we really thought we had seen it all. But then again, there's a first time for everything... You might be familiar with the Discovery Channel show, Naked and Afraid. If you're not, the premise is pretty simple. Each week, two participants are dropped off in some harsh and remote location, from the Amazon rainforest to the Sahara desert, sans food, water, shelter, and, oh yeah, clothes. Every episode remains pretty standard, with people trying to survive being, well, naked and afraid. But the jungle got shaken up on a recent episode of the Discovery Channel staple, where one of the participants decided to forgo the whole romantic dinner, roses, and nice tux proposal clichés and popped the question to his girlfriend right in the middle of the dense Thailand jungle — in the buff, of course. END
BEGIN HERE It had been a pretty rough couple of days for Naked and Afraid survivalist Matt Wright. He was hungry, tired, and, of course, naked. He couldn't catch any frogs, lost his fishing trap in the river, and was reaching his breaking point. "I've been failing at everything I try to do today," Wright told the cameras. "I would say morale is probably at an all-time low right now." END
BEGIN HERE To boost his spirits, Wright turned to a note from his girlfriend, Brooke Benham, that he had held on to throughout his jungle escapades. Reading the kind, encouraging words from his sweetheart, Wright was filled with such love for Benham (or perhaps the sun exposure was finally getting to him) and decided that now was the time to get down on one knee. END
BEGIN HERE Kneeling down next to the river, Wright declared his devotion to Benham via the cameras. END
BEGIN HERE   "Brooke, from the day I met you, I fell in love at first sight," he said. "And so I ask you now, will you make me the luckiest man in the world?" END
BEGIN HERE  The Most Adorable Real Proposals of the Week END
BEGIN HERE Wright had to wait until he was back at home in Colorado (and a little less naked) to get his answer from his girlfriend. According to People, the film crew proved Wright with a copy of his proposal and then Wright took Benham up to a campsite that he decorated with flowers and romantic string lights. Over dinner, he presented Benham with the video and got his yes! END

Wouldn't you hate to look back on photos and shutter in disgust? We think so! To avoid a dated 'do that totes makes you look stuck in the 2010s, heed the advice of these seasoned stylists, who know a thing or two about picking a timeless wedding hairstyle. END
BEGIN HERE   Trends may come and go, but according to GLAMSQUAD Creative Director Giovanni Vaccaro, there are always consistent themes that carry through from one season to the next. One such classic style is the classic chignon. "This polished and secure updo is a timeless black-tie look." For dreamy and dramatic brides with a retro-chic style, he recommends side-parted old-Hollywood waves that have great movement yet are still guaranteed to hold throughout the night. And last but not least, a half-up twist with cascading waves is a classic warm weather must. "This look initially featured a tightly pulled-back top half with defined curls, however, it has evolved into a much more delicate and romantic 'do with pieces gently pulled back in twists and braids." Perfect for the effortless boho bride. END

BEGIN HERE Grandiose gardens, tucked-away squares, and glowing monuments sitting along the Seine are just a few reasons Paris is a recipe for romance. French fare like croissants, macarons, and freshly baked baguettes don't hurt, either. Set off for the City of Light planning the honeymoon of your dreams that's packed with romance from start to finish, indulging in fine dining as well as the finest of wines, and staying in a suite so stunning, you may never even want to escape those four walls, except to step out on the balcony for sweeping views over the Eiffel Tower.

With its beamed ceilings and perfectly manicured gardens, the vine-covered, 54-room hotel feels like you've stumbled upon your own private countryside manor. The 17th century residence is named after Queen Anne of Austria, who once stayed in the wing leading to the Place des Vosges, and the suites still feel every bit as regal. While you can order around-the-clock room service, it's worth indulging in the luxurious breakfast spread in the library-inspired lounge looking out to the private courtyard. END

BEGIN HERE Les Bains, the 1970s hotspot on the Parisian club scene frequented by Andy Warhol and Mick Jagger, went through a revival last year, reopening as a 39-room boutique hotel with a club that still pays homage to its past lives as a bathhouse and boîte de nuit. While the nightlife scene is one reason to sleep here post-party, the swanky suites are another. For the ultimate in romance, book the Les Bains Suite that's outfitted with a private terrace, "maxi bar" with vintage crystal, and hammam stocked with goodies from Le Labo. END

This is, after all, the first hotel in Paris to receive the prestigious title of Palace. Eighteenth century-style rooms are swathed in fine fabrics and Louis XV and XVI furniture, with windows overlooking the fashionable Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré. Cozy up in the Honeymoon Suite that reigns supreme on the hotel's top floor, with private balconies and panoramic views over the Eiffel Tower. When it comes time for a romantic candlelit dinner, you won't even have to leave the comfort of your room. Chefs will come to your kitchen and prepare a gourmet meal designed by 3 Michelin Star chef Eric Frechon. END

A stay in the opulent, five-star spot is about as decadent as you can get when it comes to honeymoon digs. Suites feature private terraces and rooftop gardens with views overlooking the Arc de Triomphe, while the rooftop restaurant, L'Oiseau Blanc, serves fresh French fare with a view over the most romantic monument of them all: the Eiffel Tower.

BEGIN HERE Let's be honest: Unless you don't have a sweet tooth, tasting your wedding cake is probably the best part of planning a wedding. Who wouldn't love indulging in totally amazing flavors, then dreaming up a gorgeous confection to cap off your first meal as a married couple? Anyone would love to be a part of it, which is why you've probably had requests from your mom, your fiancé's little brother, and your work wife to tag along and "help." So who should you actually bring with you? Our experts weigh in. END
BEGIN HERE Sitting down to a spread of amazing cake flavors is definitely fun, but when you're planning your tasting, remember that it's still part of wedding planning, which means you've got decisions to make, so invite additional guests with caution. "I see less conflict in smaller parties than I do in large groups," says Megan Kaminski, chef and owner of Megan Joy Cakes. She says to think of it like you did picking an entourage for gown shopping. "Everyone is going to have an opinion, but the most important one is yours!" END
BEGIN HERE Be strategic with who you invite, opting for one or two additional guests who share and understand your vision for the big day. "They'll be helpful, rather than distracting," Kaminski explains. Wedding planners are a good option, since they'll be able to help with the technical details like colors, design inspiration, how the cake will be displayed, and whether or not you plan to move it during the reception (which Kaminski thinks you really shouldn't do!). "But remember that this information can all be communicated between your planner and your cake designer on the phone or via email as the process continues," she says. END
BEGIN HERE If you're hoping to serve a menu that really appeals to your guests, bringing an additional family member or a friend can be helpful, especially if you're considering more unique flavors. This should still be someone who's supportive and understanding, though. "It's your wedding day, not theirs, so pick a person who will know when to play Devil's Advocate, and when to let you make the choice that's right for you," Kaminski concludes. END
BEGIN HERE 7 Wedding Cake Trends to Try for Your Big Day END
BEGIN HERE If you do plan to bring an additional person or two to your cake tasting, be sure to let your baker know in advance so he or she can prepare enough samples for everyone. Keep in mind that this could increase your tasting fee, too. END
BEGIN HERE Or, go just the two of you! Get creative with flavor combinations, get to know your baker, and daydream about what that first bite will be like on your wedding day. END
BEGIN HERE The world is still happily sipping on Beyoncé's Lemonade after the world premier of her HBO special last night. And once we discovered that the hour-long visual album featured never-before-seen videos of, not one, but two Knowles family weddings, we can't help but take a few delicious gulps, too! END
BEGIN HERE The Beyhive (as Beyoncé's most devout fans are known) have been eagerly awaiting the debut of Lemonade since the mega superstar announced the HBO special only a week ago on social media. But besides counting down the days, fans were also wondering what the heck the television event was even really about. Turns out, Lemonade was a sweet-and-sour series of gorgeously visual music videos, following by the surprise drop of Beyoncé's similarly-titled album on Tidal, Jay-Z's streaming service. END
BEGIN HERE Full of visual symbolism and tons of spoken word, Saturday's night premier also had fans worrying that the references to infidelity and heartbreak littered throughout the special were referring to a collapsing relationship between the superstar singer and Jay-Z. But by Lemonade's end, there were no doubts about the happy ending to the story of one of our favorite A-list pairs. Why, you ask? The just-too-sweet (and never-before-released!) wedding videos and photos at the close of show. END

BEGIN HERE In 2016, hotels are out and non-traditional venues — think: a historic site, such as a library or museum, a private estate, a barn, or even your backyard — are very in. "Non-traditional venues are becoming more popular with millennial couples, as the pressure to throw an Instagram-worthy bash increases," explains Francie Dorman, co-owner of 42 North Weddings in Boston. END
BEGIN HERE But for all their charms, non-traditional venues don't come problem-free. "While hotels, function halls and select restaurants are built to service large events, a non-traditional venue would be one where many of those core aspects need to be contracted and brought in separately," explains Britt Cole, co-owner of 42 North Weddings. END
BEGIN HERE So before you plan your big day bash at a non-traditional venue, Dorman and Cole have seven things you cannot forget to consider. END
BEGIN HERE   You may think that hosting your wedding at a non-traditional venue will save you beaucoup bucks. And you might be surprised to find out that's not always the case. "Your budget is something that should be considered from the very beginning when planning a wedding at a non-traditional venue," Cole says. "There is a common misconception that anything DIY equals a smaller budget, but that is simply not the case when it comes to planning a large wedding at a private home, because you have to bring in so many additional resources. Do your homework before diving in." END

Our Bustle 101 guide will help you find the best bustle style for your unique bridal look. END
BEGIN HERE   This bustle tends to transform the dress silhouette from the back, essentially making the train "disappear". Occasionally referred to as a flip-up, or flip-under, bustle and most popular for ball gowns, this style can take a train from dramatic to demure. END
BEGIN HERE Most brides want all eyes on them as they walk down the aisle, but extending invites to superstar celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Kanye West means that a bride has to be somewhat comfortable with sharing the spotlight. Kimye played the part of ultra-stylish wedding guests this weekend at the Miami nupitals between club owner Dave Grutman and Isabela Rangel. And between their head-turning attire and an "Imma let you finish" joke by Kanye himself, the famous pair's presence was definitely known throughout the glam and glitzy big day. END
BEGIN HERE The April 23 Miami wedding turned out to be a lavish and star-studded affair, with celebs like Ryan Seacrest, Michael Bay, Hulk Hogan, and Wilmer Valderrama all in attendance, according to People. But things definitely took an extravagant turn when the Kardashian-West duo rolled up to the scene. West kept things classic in a clean-cut and dapper black suit. Meanwhile, Kardashian, dressed in sultry black dress that certainly wasn't short on the cleavage or curve-hugging sex appeal. Well, at least she didn't wear white, right? END
BEGIN HERE But the most memorable part of the whole night — besides the "I do's," of course — was when West poked a little fun at himself with a pretty epic reference to his infamous 2009 VMA moment. At the reception, as the typical toasts were being made, the rapper stole the show doing what he does best — interrupting speeches. END
BEGIN HERE "Imma let you finish," West began, in what would normally be a total toast faux-pas, as he stole the mic away from one of the groomsmen. "But Dave and Isabela had one of the best weddings of all time!" END

BEGIN HERE Before you start fuming for the bride and groom, it seems like everyone loved the perfectly-timed interruption, according to the Instagram video below, as the the entire wedding party broke into applause and laughter. Guess Kanye is the only wedding guest in history to possibly turn this major faux-pas into a total crowd-pleaser. END
BEGIN HERE You've spent weeks — and quite a few tears — getting your wedding seat chart just oh-so-right. (Should your divorced aunt and uncle be at the same table? Where on earth should you put that second cousin of your hubby's? What's the world record for the number of chairs crammed around a single table?) But alas, it could all very well be in vain if your guests aren't sure of where to sit come the wedding reception. Nip that problem in the bud with the prettiest of place cards adorning your tabletops. END
BEGIN HERE First, it's important to note that place cards and escort cards are not one in the same. While escort cards point guests to just a particular table at the reception, place cards direct them to a designated seat, and are thus sometimes referred to as a slightly more formal choice when it comes to reception seating assignments. END
BEGIN HERE Place cards just don't tell guests where to go, but they can also help pull your whole wedding table défor — from the flowers to the china — together, like a neat little bow. We've collected a few of our absolute faves below for you to peruse — all completely shoppable and fit for just about any big day style! END

BEGIN HERE Whether you've lived together for years and don't really need to upgrade your home, have a tiny space that won't fit a stand mixer and new luggage, or are working on a project that's getting pricey, sometimes all you really want as a wedding gift is cash. But tradition is tradition, and some people just really want to give you a physical gift! Can you ask guests to skip the wrapping paper and go straight for the check? We have a few tips for how to do just that. END
BEGIN HERE One of the best things to happen to wedding registries is the invention of the cash fund, championed by sites like Honeyfund and Zola. You can ask guests to pitch in for your honeymoon flights, add money to your downpayment fund, or help you pay for new furniture — you know, once you've moved into your new place and finally know what you'll need! If you'd much rather have guests help out with one of these items than buy you a new set of plates, skip the traditional registry and put a little extra time into personalizing your cash fund. Sure, Aunt Sue's $200 gift won't necessarily pay for dinner on your first night in Bali, but it will help cover the costs of your once-in-a-lifetime trip in one way or another! END
BEGIN HERE If you're in the middle of a big project, like renovating your home or moving across the country, let guests know about it on your wedding website. Adding a more personal touch with the story of how the project got started, how far along you are, and even the pitfalls you've faced along the way (now that you know how expensive it is to rewire your whole house!) will both make your guests feel more connected to your lives if they send you a check and also serve as a plea for help that they'll be more inclined to answer. END
BEGIN HERE And finally, use the grapevine to spread the word. If guests are asking your parents and wedding party about what kinds of gifts you might like (and why you're not registered for new pots and pans), arming them with the details to let guests know what you'd really like will (hopefully) avoid too many awkward conversations and help get you the checks you really want.

BEGIN HERE Anna Newell Jones is a blogger, author of the new book The Spender's Guide to Debt Free Living: How a Spending Fast Helped Me Get from Broke to Badass in Record Time, and wedding photographer based in Denver, Colorado, where she lives with her feisty husband and sassy two-year-old. Here, Anna tells her story of how her wedding spending spree pushed her deep into the red. Find out her wedding budget missteps, and how she finally told her husband the truth about her debt.  END
BEGIN HERE As I sat in front of my computer at two in the morning typing in my credit card info for an $80 custom zombie wedding cake topper (I thought it was a clever play on the whole "Until Death Do You Part" thing), I got that sinking feeling in my gut again, a feeling I'd felt so often I barely even noticed it anymore. I was spending money I didn't have on things I didn't need. It was a maddening cycle I had been in for over nine years. Overspending was a way of life for me, and because of it I would go over my wedding budget by 90 percent and amass, within my first year of marriage, close to $24,000 in debt. END
BEGIN HERE Here's the story: I'm a wedding photographer. I love the work, and have carved out a solid business for myself. However, I'm not rich, so when we told my parents we were getting married, they gave us $3,000 to help pay for it, and we decided to add as much as needed to craft the small and simple-but-elegant wedding we imagined. Then all hell broke loose, because suddenly I had "permission" to spend — it was my wedding, after all, and I deserved a perfect day, one that represented exactly who my fiancé and I were, who we'd be as a married couple. So my already poor spending habits (mostly buying poorly constructed clothing) morphed into terrible habits. I was throwing my card down for everything I may want for this party: far too many miniature candles, countless invitation samples, and seven headpiece options — two headbands, a paper flower, a papier-mâché flower-and-twigs "crown" (cooler than it sounds), a retro 1920s feather clip, and a fluffy-but-not-too-fluffy ivory tulle veil that would be the ultimate winner. END
BEGIN HERE Then came the hangover. Thanks to the decade-long spending orgy culminating with my wedding, my first year of marriage was a mess of stress and anxiety. I'd done my best to keep my spending habits hidden from my husband, but I hit my financial bottom seven months after the wedding, when suddenly the denial that had kept me plopping down my Visa for all those years just no longer worked. I was married, I was ready to be an adult, and I was sick of this secret debt overshadowing my life. I knew it was time for a change. END
BEGIN HERE   Then, when I was on a plane headed to visit my Midwest family for the holidays, I started thinking about an idea I had heard in passing but had brushed off in the past. The idea? Do a Spending Fast. END
BEGIN HERE At the time there was nothing online about how Spending Fasts work or how to go about doing one so I decided that based on the name I'd make my own rules. I'd start by doing the painful task of building my Reverse Budget (basically a spending inventory) and then, I built what turned out to be the backbone of the Spending Fast, my Wants and Needs list. The basic idea is that I decided I would only spend money on the necessities I needed for survival. And, oh yeah, I was going to do it for a year and write all about it on my blog. END
BEGIN HERE The next step was to tell my brand-new husband the extent of my spending damage. I brought it up casually, after dinner on a random Tuesday. We were seated comfortably on the couch getting ready to watch one of our guilty-pleasure shows on TV. I mentioned how my debt had been weighing incredibly heavy on me and how I was finally ready to do something kind of extreme to try to tackle it once-and-for-all. I quickly shifted gears to my plan: that I'd be doing a spending fast for a year, and documenting the process on a blog I was starting. I figured that if I acted cool with a hint of "trust me this is gonna be good," he'd be into the idea too. END
BEGIN HERE To say he was not excited would be a massive understatement. Aaron is a moderate spender who only owed on a small college loan, and didn't understand the need for such extreme measures. He admitted that my spending concerned him, even if he'd mostly turned a blind eye to it, and that it was the main reason he didn't want to get a joint checking account with me. I'd thought it was because we were so cool and modern and had our own things going on. Realizing he had so little faith in my financial stability stung. END
BEGIN HERE   I'm an all-or-nothing type of person. I don't just "kind of" do something. I really do it. So sending an extra $30 the credit card companies every month wasn't working for me. I saw no positive movement on my statements, I was beyond discouraged, and I knew that if I was going to make any progress on my debts I was going to have to go all in. I cut out the wants and focused on the needs. I sacrificed, I learned to tell myself no, I made tough decisions. And I started seeing incredible results from my efforts, which motivated me to find ways to spend even less money. It was insanely addictive to see the numbers on my statements go down; I was actually enjoying paying off my debt, and I was feeling empowered. Paying down my debt became more satisfying than the accumulating of stuff that had led to it in the first place. END
BEGIN HERE I'd set a year as my goal, and in the end it took 15 months to be debt-free. To celebrate, Aaron and I opened a joint checking account. The fast was good for my mental health, my financial health, and my marriage. END
BEGIN HERE The first year of marriage is hard. Going into it with a pile of debt is not a stable foundation for the rest of your life. Because I got deeply into — and out of — the red, and because of my job as a wedding photographer, I have a pretty good idea of where you can cut back to stay on budget. Here are some tips to avoid the wedding debt trap: END

BEGIN HERE As far as rockstar weddings go (or rockstar offsprings' weddings, in this case), the "I dos" between Mick Jagger's son James Jagger — currently the star of HBO's Vinyl — and Anoushka Sharma were definitely a tad more traditional, especially when compared to the nuptials of the groom's dear old dad! The younger Jagger just married his girlfriend of seven years over the weekend, and considering the prim and proper British venue and classic wedding style, his weekend nuptials were certainly a far cry from Mick Jagger's St. Tropez and Indonesian rockstar-approved weddings. END
BEGIN HERE The Jagger dynasty earned itself a plus-one with the addition of former shop assistant, Anoushka Sharma, who tied the knot with James Jagger on Saturday, April 23. Sharma, who met her now-husband back when she was working his sister's jewelry boutique, has since left retail life behind to pursue a career in the arts — which we're sure her new famous father-in-law is definitely in support of! But would these traditional nuptials get his stamp of approval? END
BEGIN HERE The bride donned a classic lace wedding dress, complete with long sleeves, an illusion neckline, and embroidered veil, for her wedding at the stately Cornwell Manor in Oxfordshire, according to the U.K.'s Telegraph. After tying the knot ahead of Saturday's celebration in a private ceremony up in the Catskills mountains, they couple played host to about 200 guests during their official wedding weekend, including the groom's mother and new step-father, Jerry Hall and Rupert Murdoch, who wed earlier this year. (We can't help but wonder what it's like being engaged at the same time as your mother...) Rolling Stones rocker Ronnie Woods was also in attendance, of course, but alas the newlyweds didn't take their first spin on the dance floor to "Wild Horses," instead opting for "It Must Be Love" by Madness as their first dance song. END
BEGIN HERE Although the groom's sister, Georgia May Jagger, and the groom himself got a little funky with their wedding attire, both wearing tailored suits in colorful hues, the majority of the matrimony looked to be as traditional as their English countryside surroundings A.K.A. almost nothing like the nuptials between James Jagger's parents, who were wed in Bali by a Hindu priest back in 1990 — a union which was later deemed not even legal by the High Court of England and Wales!

BEGIN HERE It's a smart rule-of-thumb to never use your work computer or phone to conduct personal business. But with the average wedding taking hundreds of hours to plan, it's likely you'll have to dedicate some on-the-job time to wedding planning. END
BEGIN HERE But remember, says Vicki Salemi, career expert for Monster, "your employer can easily monitor all of the moves you make on company-owned devices — and if you're caught? It's bad news." Even if you boss doesn't give you the boot, he or she could put you on an official performance improvement plan or force you into an awkward talk about how you need to focus on your job. END
BEGIN HERE The key, then, is to use your work time smartly to wedding plan — and in ways that won't get you in trouble. And Salemi is here to show you how. END
BEGIN HERE   Says Salemi, "During your planning breaks you may use social media to research things like floral arrangements, look up vendors, schedule appointments, and more. And it may be tempting to retweet articles or post photos on your Pinterest board, but refrain during work hours." Your boss wants to see proof you were working, after all — not proof that you used on-the-work hours to find the perfect chandelier earrings to go with your gown. "Stay mum on social at the office, and instead, make note of sites you're exploring so you can go back later and share all you want, on your own time," she says. END

BEGIN HERE Channeling a Madonna-bride vibe, the 37-year-old Almost Famous actress rocked a veil, crop top, and white fishnets — making for one rocker-chic bride, according to ET Online. The soirée hosted a variety of celebrity guests including Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Poppy Delevinge, Demi Moore, Rumer Willis, Naomi Campbell, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Rachel Zoe, all who were decked out in either wedding dresses or bridesmaid dresses that would give 27 Dresses star Katherine Heigel a run for her money (that green one though, woof!). Some of the star-studded crew even wore veils — and Hudson crimped her hair, in true "Material-Girl" style. END
BEGIN HERE On her actual birthday, April 19, the mother-of-two snapped an Instagram photo of a meditation circle with her best girls, sharing, "Birthday meditation went just as planned: Intentions set, tears shed, laughter achieved and then some, and enough love in one circle to last many lifetimes #lovemygirlfriends #lovemymama #callingonangels." Of course, this came right after a hilarious IG video of some shirtless men paying her an unexpected visit to her home — starting her birthday off the right way, that's for sure (see below!). END
BEGIN HERE It's been awhile since we've spotted the actress in anything resembling a bridal role off-screen. In December, Hudson split from Muse lead singer Matt Bellamy after four years, ending their engagement. The actress was previously married to The Black Crowes frontman Chris Robinson. The actress has most recently has been linked to Nick Jonas and Houston Texan defensive end J.J. Watt. END

BEGIN HERE The letter, published by The New York Times, addressed the doctors, nurses, respiratory specialists, social workers, and cleaning staff workers that were involved in the care for Levis, and it is so beautifully written it will both break your heart and make you happy that love as true as Levis and DeMarco's exists. END
BEGIN HERE DeMarco, a writer from Boston, wrote that he knows everyone who cared for his wife by name, and that he felt he would not have been able to get through this tough time without them. END
BEGIN HERE "Every single one of you treated Laura with such professionalism, and kindness, and dignity as she lay unconscious. When she needed shots, you apologized that it was going to hurt a little, whether or not she could hear. When you listened to her heart and lungs through your stethoscopes, and her gown began to slip, you pulled it up to respectfully cover her. You spread a blanket, not only when her body temperature needed regulating, but also when the room was just a little cold, and you thought she'd sleep more comfortably that way," he wrote. END
BEGIN HERE He went on to talk about how the staff helped Levis' parents feel comfortable in the uncomfortable hospital room, and made sure that they felt involved in the treatment process. The staff even allowed him to sneak in the couple's cat, Cola, into the room to give Levis' face one last lick. During her last night on earth, the staff let DeMarco bring more that 50 of Levis' closest friends, family, and co-workers into her room for a night of guitar playing, opera singing, and dancing, something that DeMarco says was the "last great night of our marriage together, for both of us, and it wouldn't have happened without your support." END
BEGIN HERE The most touching part of the letter is when he talks about his last moments with Levis, after a day of people coming in and our of her room to say goodbye. DeMarco had asked two staff members, Donna and Jen, to help him set up the recliner close to Levis' bed so that he can be close to her while he slept, and they did something even better. END
BEGIN HERE "They asked me to leave the room for a moment, and when I returned, they had shifted Laura to the right side of her bed, leaving just enough room for me to crawl in with her one last time. I asked if they could give us one hour without a single interruption, and they nodded, closing the curtains and the doors, and shutting off the lights." END
BEGIN HERE What followed was their last tender moment together as husband and wife, something DeMarco says he will cherish forever. END

BEGIN HERE  This Bride Shut DOWN the Haters with Breastfeeding Wedding Photo END
BEGIN HERE While first looks are becoming more and more popular as both an opportunity to have a few quiet moments together before the celebrations begin and to get some extra pictures done before the ceremony, it isn't for everyone. Some couples still choose to stick to tradition, spending the night before the wedding apart and seeing one another for the first time as they reach the altar. If you fall into the latter camp and are skipping your first look, there are a few things you should keep in mind. Our experts are here to break it down for you! END
BEGIN HERE If you're not having a first look, the biggest thing to be aware of is your timeline. Sure, you can do pictures with your bridesmaids and immediate family before you walk down the aisle, but you'll need to include extra time post-ceremony for things like your couple portraits, photos of the entire wedding party, and pictures of your families with the two of you. When you're making your must-have photo list with your photographer, work with him or her to break down what you'll be able to get beforehand and what you'll have to save until after your "I dos." Depending on how long your list is, you may want to discuss having your photographer bring a second-shooter to help get as many pre-ceremony pictures done as possible so you're not left missing all of cocktail hour. END
BEGIN HERE  The Pros and Cons of Having a First Look END
BEGIN HERE Your timeline should also include specifics to help keep the two of you apart before the ceremony. If you're staying at the same hotel, schedule your walks or drives to the ceremony venue to happen 10-15 minutes apart, so you can get through the lobby (and into your ceremony venue!) without bumping into one another. Make sure there is a room you can head to where you'll be out of sight — most houses of worship have a bridal suite or meeting room that's designated for the bride, where she can tuck away with her 'maids until all the guests are seated. END
BEGIN HERE Do you want to save the "look" for the aisle, but still wish you could have a moment together before you exchange vows? There are a few alternative ideas that make for sweet pictures without ruining the surprise. One is to stand on either side of a doorway or around a corner and hold hands. You can exchange notes, talk to one another, say a prayer, or do whatever will help calm your nerves. Another option is to have your groom positioned somewhere with a blindfold on, then have the bride walk out and stand back-to-back with him. You'll be able to touch and speak to one another, but your dress will still be a big surprise! END
BEGIN HERE When you're starting to iron out your guest list and are deciding on take off the list, there are a few things you and your partner will have to make a decision on — one being are children allowed at your wedding. With this decision comes a few questions: do you have friends who are expecting a child right around your wedding that will need childcare? Do you want to invite just babies to the wedding (and no small children who are mobile)? Or, do you want to invite children regardless of their ages? END
BEGIN HERE The child guest list decision is a difficult one. Some brides think it's more practical and budget-friendly to say "no" to all children, but not letting your friends bring their babies may mean that your friends won't be able to come. END
BEGIN HERE When you are making this decision, the first thing you should do is see if you can create some kind of environment for your babies to stay in throughout the night. Perhaps you can turn an extra bridal suite at the venue into a playroom — where a professional babysitter is hired to watch the little ones for the night. If the venue isn't equipped for that, another option is to invite the parents with their babies and let them know that just coming to the ceremony or reception is fine and both are not required. Giving them the option to come and go as needed may have many moms and dads on your guest list feeling less stressed about attending the wedding with a new baby. END
BEGIN HERE  How Do We Let Guests with Children Know We're Serving a Kids' Menu? END
BEGIN HERE If you really don't want any children at your wedding, you can make that decision and pass it along to your friends in advance (who then will make the decision about whether or not they'd like to come or leave their baby at home). Either way you decide, as the bride — it's ultimately your decision, so just make sure that you tell your friends beforehand so there is no confusion. END

While it may seem like just another thing you have to do before you walk down the aisle, if you think of it as a multi-tasking opportunity, it's easily achieved! Besides, its fun to participate in old traditions, and what bride doesn't want to kill two birds with one stone (and save some money while being sentimental, too)? END

Nothing is classier than a quality, antique handkerchief to have handy for all of those happy wedding tears. This is also one of the easiest and most subtle ways to incorporate a "something borrowed" — especially for brides who want a look that is new and uniquely hew own.

BEGIN HERE Your wedding invitation is more than just a pretty card in an envelope. Even the most simple of designs includes a few extra pieces (namely an RSVP card and envelope), before you start adding on things like envelope liners and bellybands. For couples having a destination wedding in particular, the sheer volume of information often requires an additional card, called an invitation insert or an information card. But what is it for? We asked our experts to spill on the details. END
BEGIN HERE An information card or invitation insert is a useful way to share extra information with your wedding guests, without crowding the main invitation full of logistics. The invitation itself should list your names, your wedding date, the location, the start time, and the dress code — and that's it. Want to share anything more? That's where the insert comes in. END
BEGIN HERE If you're having your ceremony and reception at two different locations, your invitation will list the ceremony location and then should say "reception to follow." The time and location of your reception sometimes get their own insert, especially if you want to include directions or parking information for the venue. END
BEGIN HERE For any pre- and post-wedding events that won't have their own invitation mailed separately, put the date, time, and dress code on an insert (i.e. "Please join us for a welcome party the night before the wedding! Meet us at the hotel bar at 8 p.m. for cocktails and desserts."). If you're hoping to get a specific R.S.V.P. count, you should either send an invitation in the mail or send out an e-vite. END
BEGIN HERE  When is it Okay to Put Registry Information on Wedding Invitations? END
BEGIN HERE Having a shuttle to transport guests to and from your ceremony and reception? While you may not have the exact shuttle times figured out before your invitations are sent, put a note on the insert that specifies that the shuttle will be available (or that it's required and that they shouldn't plan to drive to your venue). END
BEGIN HERE The insert can also provide an overview of travel options, such as the name of the nearest airport and the names, websites, and phone numbers for any hotels where you've reserved a block of rooms. Be sure to include the reservation code if your hotel requires one! END

If you're caught regifting, Swann says, the person who gave you the gift "may be hurt or offended, and there's nothing you can do about that process." She recommends acknowledging the person's feelings, apologizing, and putting forth an effort to move forward. Don't try to come up with a lie to cover up what happened, she says. Instead, after apologizing for the person's hurt feelings, say something like "[the gift was] not really my taste or style, but I really thought that [X person] would enjoy it." Whitmore says, "Honesty is always the best policy." END
BEGIN HERE Whether you and your spouse-to-be are hopeless romantics à la Romeo and Juliet, hard-partying sophisticates like Gatsby and Daisy, or witty banterers like Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, what better way to show off your brainy side than with a museum or library wedding? With unique artwork displayed throughout, spaces that lend themselves to personalization, these literary venues in Philadelphia will make sure your bash is the perfect start to this next chapter in your lives.

BEGIN HERE There are plenty of fish in the sea, but Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte is officially no longer one of them! The Olympian is engaged to his girlfriend Kayla Rae Reid, after popping the question over the weekend. So did Lochte choose an engagement ring for his sweetheart that could reveal the shine of his six gold medals? Definitely! And it's scoring straight tens from these judges! END
BEGIN HERE Like he does through an Olympic-sized swimming pool, Lochte definitely picked up the pace in this relationship. Lochte and Reid, a Playboy model, only started dating a mere nine months ago after meeting in January. But after Lochte's sweetheart stood by his side during his much-publicized Rio scandal, the girl won the gold when it came to the Olympian's heart. "My family says, 'Don't you think it's a little too soon?' I'm like, 'Can you put a time on love? Can you?'" Lochte told USA Today just less than a week before popping the question. "When I realized this was 'the one' was when she stuck behind me through this. She still loves me and she's still right there with me." END
BEGIN HERE "From the very first time I met her, everything has like clicked,'" Lochte continued. "That's why I know I can propose to her because everything that's happened and she's been keeping me so positive. She doesn't care about my fame. She doesn't care about anything. All she cares about is me being happy." And propose he did! END
BEGIN HERE Lochte and his new fiancé took to Instagram to tell the world that they're tying the knot, posting photos overlooking Los Angeles' Malibu Canyon — the most picture-perfect proposal spot! END

Absolutely beautiful. So in love with YOU," Reid wrote beside hers. Meanwhile, we're struck speechless by Reid's new bridal bling! END
BEGIN HERE From the looks of it, it seems that her engagement ring totes a princess-cut or cushion-cut diamond on a sleek silver band. While we can't wait to get a closer look, we're already shielding our eyes from the sparkle from all the way over here. In our humble opinion, this bling is even better than any old gold medal! END
BEGIN HERE Big gestures are great. (No one would turn down a surprise weekend getaway, are we right?) But if we're honest, it's really the little, everyday things that count — especially when it comes to marriage.  END
BEGIN HERE "The little everyday things you do for your partner lets them know that you are thinking about them and the relationship," explains Lesli Doares, marriage coach and author of Blueprint For A Lasting Marriage. And they also make your marriage stronger. Ready to dive in? Our experts recommend making these five things part of your daily routine with your partner.   END
BEGIN HERE    You may respond to acts of service — think: your husband taking out the trash is the sexiest thing he can possibly do — but your partner may need to hear words of affirmation to feel loved. If you can figure out how your spouse sees your love most clearly, you can strengthen your relationship. "Daily affirmations of love help keep that love alive and vibrant," says Doares. "Those declarations are most meaningful if they are expressed in the way your partner really experiences love."   END
BEGIN HERE If your big day disaster consisted of a drunk groomsmen taking a spill on the dance floor or your florist forgetting the bouquet, you can officially count yourself lucky. In a recently surfaced video, a bride's happily ever after was hijacked when her groom's secret girlfriend showed up at her wedding — wearing a freakin' wedding dress! Worst. Nightmare. Realized. We'd take our wedding cake falling to the floor over this, any day.  END
BEGIN HERE This vengeful lady takes wedding crashing to whole new levels. So kudos on that, we guess? But there's really nothing very redeemable about this pseudo-bride who stormed the altar on someone else's big day... Or the groom, for that matter. Remember your constant nightmare throughout college of someone showing up at the party in the same dress as you? Yeahhh, this is worse. Way, way worse. END
BEGIN HERE In the footage posted by Ghana Audiovisual News, a wedding ceremony is taking place when suddenly a woman also dressed in a wedding dress rushes up to the altar, grabs the microphone, and begins addressing the room. According to Metro, the woman told the guests that the groom about to say "I do" was a womanizer, as screams and chaos ensue.  END
BEGIN HERE Members of the bridal party immediately tried to usher the woman out of the ceremony. But this chick just wasn't having any of it. She continued to stand there beside the actual bride, yelling at the couple, as the would-be Mr. and Mrs. stayed silent. According to reports, those brave bridesmaids and groomsmen eventually managed to get the gown-clad gal outside, where apparently an even more dramatic confrontation went down. Well, everyone wants their wedding to be memorable, right? Though, this probably isn't what the poor bride had in mind... END
BEGIN HERE Alas, no one knows for sure if the bride and her allegedly cheating groom actually went through with the ceremony and tied the knot. But here's hoping she took a page out of Julia Roberts' playbook in Runaway Bride and made a fast exit (preferably on horseback).  END

BEGIN HERE "We gon git mawwied y'all," she wrote on Instagram shortly before the big day, which took place at St. John's UMC in Kansas City. END
BEGIN HERE After the wedding, she posted a beautiful photo of the 'just married' duo walking down the aisle which was captioned, "This gives me all the feels. I cannot begin to describe how amazing this weekend was. I wish I could go back and relive every single moment a thousand times over. Thank you to everyone who was a part of the best day of our lives, from our wedding party, down to the very last guest. Tyler and I appreciate every single one of you." END
BEGIN HERE And those appreciated include former Bachelorette bestie Andi Dorfman, who was on bridesmaid duty during the wedding weekend (and slayed with a smoldering look in her pink-hued dress) as well as other fellow contestants Kelly Travis and Christy Hansen on the guest list. See all the gorgeous photos from their wedding day below. END
BEGIN HERE The pair got engaged last January on New Year's Eve in Colorado — with the reality star announcing the news on Instagram, according to E! Online. "And on the last day of vacation this happened! I can't wait to marry my best friend. Over the moon happy right now!" she had captioned the photo of VanLoo on one knee. END
BEGIN HERE Since then, the Midwestern bride-to-be has been enjoying #engagedlife (and sharing it with the rest of the world) on her Instagram — including some fun ring selfies of her gorgeous pear-shaped sparkler with a white gold pave band. Over Labor Day weekend, Ferrell celebrated with all of her girls at a beachy bachelorette, sharing some adorable selfies and photos of the booze and babes-filled weekend. END

BEGIN HERE We're happy that Ferrell is in a better place, as in the not-too-distant past, the reality star was sitting on a couch next to infamous Bachelor Juan Pablo — who proceeded to refuse to tell her he loved her and didn't propose at the end of the season. But as luck would have it, alls well that ends well for this nurse — and now she's happily married and most likely jetting off to her honeymoon in style. END
BEGIN HERE See below for a throwback to her year of wedding planning and some snaps from her big day, via Instagram. END
BEGIN HERE As if there wasn't enough pressure already for Prince Harry to wife up Suits actress Meghan Markle ASAP, the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda kinda just made things suuuper awkward by inviting the pair to the Caribbean island — for their honeymoon. Wait, wait, wait... their honeymoon?! Is there something we're missing here? Has the English prince gotten down on one knee without us knowing? Well, not so much.  END
BEGIN HERE According to E! News, "During a reception held in the prince's honor Monday, the 32-year-old royal looked down at his feet when Gaston Browne, Antigua and Barbuda's prime minister, mentioned his girlfriend Meghan Markle. 'I understand that there may be a new addition to the royal family very soon,' he said to Prince Harry. 'I am told that there may be a princess, and I just want to say that should you make the decision to honeymoon, then Antigua and Barbuda want to welcome you.'"  END
BEGIN HERE As sweet and welcoming that may be, we can't help but imagine what was going on inside Harry's head as the prime minister invited him and his not-even fiancé to honeymoon on the islands. But Browne wasn't done with his invitation. He went on to say, "We have been voted consistently as the best honeymoon destination in the Caribbean — and one of the best in the world — so there will be nowhere in the world as special to spend your honeymoon when that day arrives."  END
BEGIN HERE Or you know, just a nice vacation could be nice? Why does it HAVE to be his unplanned honeymoon? Ugh. We mean, trust us, we want another royal wedding just as much as anyone else, but don't we think we're being a little hard on the guy? Let him take relationship milestones at his own pace!  END
BEGIN HERE Believe it or not, this story gets even better after that little "honeymoon" chat with the PM. Appearing to have forgotten about Markle and the so-called seriousness of their relationship, Browne introduced Harry to a group of dancers while saying, "Whatever is done here, stays here. So, do not worry." Oh, ok? One woman in particular was charmed by the prince and seriously wanted to give the Suits actress a run for her money. The woman, Miss Antigua and Barbuda, reportedly said, "He was a gentleman. Of course, I want to be his princess. Everyone at this party does... His girlfriend seems like a nice lady, but I would be a good girlfriend for him." Oh boy.  END
BEGIN HERE And where was Harry's beau during all of this? After finishing up her TV production, we're sure she's resting and recuperating. Or simply avoiding all of those inevitable marriage questions in the Caribbean. Just a thought.  END
BEGIN HERE  Could Prince Harry Ever Marry Meghan Markle Since She's Been Divorced? END
BEGIN HERE One of the ten commandments of wedding day beauty is to elevate your everyday look. Look like yourself, only better, they say. For most brides, this often means make-up in neutral shades made only a little more striking to contrast against the whiteness of the dress. For others, it involves a bit more color. And while neutral is beautiful and your wedding probably isn’t the best day to try out a smoky eye for the first time, a bold look like can be pulled off in a stunning fashion, whether you fall into the latter category or want to break the commandment and dare to be different. After all, that’s what the trial run is for! Not so confident just yet? Take a look at these bridal beauties to see how it’s done. END
BEGIN HERE    Whether you’re having a holiday wedding, love a vintage or Hollywood glam look, or brick is just your color, red lips are always a good idea. While this bride keeps her look soft and matte, there are many shades you can play with, from a glossy cherry to a fire-engine red. Ask your make-up artist which one best matches your skin tone. Finish of the look with a light smoky eye for a bit of understated glam. END
BEGIN HERE When a big day disaster strikes, even the calmest bride could panic at the thought of her wedding going up in flames. But when that scenario became all too literal for one New Jersey bride, she decided that she wasn't about to let her celebration burn out. In fact, she realized that her wedding day mishap made for one heck of a photo op! When the smell of smoke and the threat of fire led to an emergency evacuation of Allison Russoniello and Kevin Duffy's wedding, they turned what could've been a total buzzkill into a red hot reception. Here's what went down... END
BEGIN HERE The bride and groom were on the dance floor post-vows, when their recent big day suddenly took a big turn. An employee of the venue grabbed the microphone and informed the party that they were under emergency evacuation.  END
BEGIN HERE "My family is all jokers and pranksters, so I was like, this is funny, who set this one up, where's the joke?" Russoniello told Today. But with guests smelling smoke and fire alarms going off, this bride very quickly realized that there was no joke. After all of their guests had safely moved outside, firefighters began storming the building. This was serious.  END
BEGIN HERE But why let a little old emergency spoil your big day? This bride wasn't about to let anything rain on (or burn down) her parade. "We figured we would make lemonade out of lemons when we can," Russoniello explained to Inside Edition. "What am I going to do? Sit in a corner and cry? I'll ruin my makeup."  END
BEGIN HERE So as the wedding party waited it out, the bride and groom climbed aboard the firetruck to snap some wedding pics that'll definitely standout on that Facebook feed! Soon after, firefighters announced that the smell was coming from a faulty fridge and cleared the building for the party to continue. And the newlyweds were so grateful to them for saving the day, they invited their new heroes to join in! END
BEGIN HERE  How Wedding Planners Expertly Recovered From These Wedding-Day Disasters END
BEGIN HERE And that's how this wedding reception grew to include a fire department, whose members were all too happy to lift the bride up for quite possibly the coolest wedding photo, ever. The DJ even hammed up the theme of the night by playing tunes like Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire," and Sean Kingston's "Fire Burning." Now this is how you handle a big day disaster! END
BEGIN HERE After their memorable night came to close, the bride and groom headed home... where they discovered that their basement was flooded with five inches of water. Yes, really."We had to laugh it off," said Russoniello.  END

BEGIN HERE Save-the-dates are a great way to give your guests a head start on planning for your wedding. It lets them know the when and the where of your celebration, as well as where they can find your wedding website with more information, so they can start booking their travel and planning their outfits. It also give them one more key piece of information: Who is invited! We asked the experts to break down the best way to address your wedding save-the-dates, so there’s less guest list confusion when it comes time to RSVP. END
BEGIN HERE The general rule of thumb is to address your save-the-dates the same way you’ll be addressing your wedding invitations. You can keep the phrasing a little more casual if you’d prefer, but you should be specific about who is and isn’t included.  END
BEGIN HERE For a couple, make sure you name both people on the envelope. For a married couple, you could use both first names (Alison and Peter Smith) or formal titles (Dr. Alison Smith and Mr. Peter Smith), and for an unmarried couple, you should specify that both parties are invited (John Brown and Sam Collins).  END
BEGIN HERE If you are inviting a couple who has children, but are not inviting their children, be sure to use the parents’ names on the envelope (Mr. Peter and Mrs. Alison Smith) instead of something like “The Smiths,” which implies that the entire family is invited.  END
BEGIN HERE Planning to include children in your wedding invitation? You could either address the save-the-date to “The Smith Family” or to “Mr. Peter and Mrs. Alison Smith,” and then on the next line, list the names of the children. END
BEGIN HERE For someone invited with a guest, make sure to denote that on their save-the-date. The card should be addressed “Natalie Michaels and Guest” so he or she knows that they can bring a plus-one with them — and let their guest know to keep your wedding weekend open! END
BEGIN HERE  Everything You Need to Include on Your Destination Wedding Save-the-Dates END
BEGIN HERE Set up on a blind date by friends, Kate Olmstead and Garrett Mitchell’s first date started as a morning coffee chat, but turned into a 13-hour marathon. "We ended up making dinner plans and accidentally met my parents while they were in town," says Kate. "We had so much fun together that first week, and were always waiting to see each other. We were engaged a year and a half later, and married eight months after that." Turns out, your friends and family just might know what (or who!) is best for you!  END
BEGIN HERE After a Bachelorette-style proposal (Kate was given a red rose, then lead to a dock where Garrett was waiting with a ring!), the California couple set their sites on a venue. The bride works for Marriott International, so while she loves a great ballroom, she knew she wanted to be outside in the fresh air. "Ponte Winery in Temecula was one of the first places I took Garrett when we started dating," says Kate. "It’s also perfectly located between our families in San Diego and Orange County, and I love the sweet bridal cottages just off of the ceremony space!" This elegant, understated winery wedding on October 18, 2015, is full of personal details true to the couple (with a few fun quirks thrown in!), and you won’t believe they got it all together so quickly! Take a peek at the photos, by Jackie Wonders, below.  END
BEGIN HERE Even a relaxed wedding in wine country needs some sparkle! Kate’s Badgley Michska pumps were classic in the front, and totally glam in the back. Her Anais Anette wedding dress was a modified A-line made of heavy lace, which Kate topped with a removable tulle skirt. "I loved the idea of being able to change my look between the ceremony and reception," she says.  END
BEGIN HERE Garrett added a jacket to his fitted gray suit to differentiate his look from his groomsmen, who donned just a vest. Kate’s bridesmaids all wore convertible Jenny Yoo gowns, which they tied in a variety of different ways so each woman could have her own style.   END
BEGIN HERE The couple’s moody fall florals incorporated lots of succulents and dusty miller for texture, with a few peach and white roses thrown in for contrast. "We wanted everything in blush, gray, and cream, with plum accents and greenery for a rustic twist," Kate says of the design. The flower girl insisted on wearing a dress just like the bride's, and she looked so sweet in her tulle and lace frock. She topped it all off with a crown of berries and a wooden pail full of petals. The ring bearer’s bowtie matched the groom’s, and we love the combination of suspenders and desert boots!  END
BEGIN HERE The ceremony took place beneath the venue’s arch, which had been expertly dressed up with fresh foliage, roses, and peonies. Guests followed along with simple printed ceremony programs.   END
BEGIN HERE Along the aisle, wooden folding chairs were decorated with iron vessels holding lavender, succulents, eucalyptus, olive branches, and small white roses.   END
BEGIN HERE "Garrett’s cousin officiated our wedding," says Kate. "It was so special to have a family member join us in marriage. He and Garrett could barely hold it together during the ceremony because of their family bond." END
BEGIN HERE Cocktail hour took place on the patio, where guests sipped Kate’s favorite wine from the vineyard, Super T, and Garrett’s favorite beer, Ballast Point Sculpin IPA. In keeping with the succulent theme, each escort card (which doubled as a favor) was a succulent planted in a mercury glass jar — hand-planted by the bride and groom! "We loved how the clusters of succulents added to the table décor once guests had taken their seats," says the bride.   END
BEGIN HERE Inside, the newlyweds sat at a sweetheart table framed with greenery, white peonies, and woven orbs strung with café lights. Their loveseat is actually a piece from their own home, purchased for their wedding and now tucked in Kate’s office. The table was lit with dozens of candles in mercury glass holders, with small arrangements of succulents and dusty pink roses in between.   END
BEGIN HERE Round tables were topped with small coordinated arrangements, then lit with clusters of candles. Peonies added texture, while soft astilbe and seeded eucalyptus gave the centerpieces some height. For dinner, guests were served a surf-and-turf meal of porcini-crusted sea bass and filet mignon in a wine sauce.  END
BEGIN HERE The pair’s alternative guest book is so creative: "I’m the queen of snail mail," says Kate, "So we got a mail box and had our stationers make postcards, pre-addressed to our home, with different prompts for advice and memories." Guests filled out the cards, and Garrett’s mom has been mailing a few notes to the couple each month. "It’s the wedding gift that keeps on giving!"   END
BEGIN HERE Garrett and Kate cut into a three-tiered wedding cake, frosted with palette knife lines and finished with fresh flowers. Two tiers were carrot cake, while the third was French vanilla and almond champagne cake with raspberry cream cheese filling. But that wasn’t all... END
BEGIN HERE "We had a groom’s cake designed to look like a storm trooper, because Garrett loves Star Wars," says Kate. "He and I also both love donuts, so we purchased sprinkle and maple donuts from the bakery near our home. We’re always bragging about how amazing they are, and loved getting to share them with our friends!" END
BEGIN HERE When the night came to an end, the pair exited beneath a deluge of streamers. "Don’t plan your wedding like it’s the last event of your life," says Kate. "Instead, spend those months investing in and enjoying each other. That’s why you’re getting married!" END

BEGIN HERE We love heels just as much as the next girl, but sometimes the last thing you want to worry about is aching feet. Or tripping. Especially when it comes to your wedding day. To eliminate that particular stress from your list of wedding worries, we've rounded up a variety of comfortable wedding flats that don't sacrifice an ounce of style. (Quite the contrary, in fact. Lest you need more convincing, we'll remind you that one of the Chicest Women of All Time, Audrey Hepburn, was known for wearing ballet flats.)  END
BEGIN HERE    1. These d'orsay flats have everything the classic bride could want: white lace and just enough sparkle. ($200, Cecelia, NY available at BHLDN) END
BEGIN HERE    2. Marchesa's shoes are just as beautiful as their dresses — and these delicate gold flats are proof. How exquisite are the cut-out leaf details? We're envisioning them worn with an ethereal floral mini dress for a garden wedding. So pretty.  ($765, Marchesa available at AKH Group)  END
BEGIN HERE    3. You won't need to pile on the accessories when wearing these jewel-encrusted shoes — they practically take the place of jewelry! Show them off with a short dress, or wear a long, simple sheath and let them catch the light ever so subtly while you're walking down the aisle. ($75, Badgley Mischka available at Lord and Taylor)  END
BEGIN HERE    4. Wear these sapphire flats as your something blue, or, go against the grain and pair them with a pale, blueish gray gown — it will create the most beautiful palette. ($2,725, Jimmy Choo) END
BEGIN HERE    5. Minimalist doesn't mean boring: We love the subtle details on these flats, like the chalk white pave crystals, and the lace-up ankle straps that are just trendy enough. ($2,200, Stuart Weitzman with Swarovski crystals)  END
BEGIN HERE    6. There's hardly a better way to infuse a bit of fun and personality into your big-day look than with shoes. And in this case, that means pink, sparkly shoes. After all, white goes with everything, right? Do you, girl. ($735, Malone Souliers available at Avenue 32)  END
BEGIN HERE Hey, you guuuys! The Goonies star Corey Feldman is married! It was just revealed that the '80s child star whose resume totes tons of nostalgic titles like The Fox and the Hound, Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter, Stand by Me, The Lost Boys, and Gremlins married his girlfriend Courtney Anne just days after announcing their engagement. END
BEGIN HERE The actor revealed the news to TooFab on Tuesday, November 22, while at his wedding reception. Feldman, 45, and his bride, 27, exchanged vows in Las Vegas at Caesars Palace, the site reports — they were already in the city celebrating their joint bachelor-bachelorette party with friends. END
BEGIN HERE The actor gave some inkling via Twitter that something special was going down yesterday morning: "Happy 222 Day #EVERYBODY I Hav a feeling 2DAY is gonna B super special! ✌🏼️❤️😇🙏🏼"  END
BEGIN HERE Later in the evening, Feldman tweeted again "C.....I told U all 2Day would b a special 1! #StayTuned #More2Come" with a link to the TooFab article. END
BEGIN HERE Feldman popped the question to his love while the couple was vacationing at Palm Springs' Two Bunch Palms Resort celebrating their fourth anniversary, People reports. But in lieu of getting down on knee with a diamond ring, Feldman went with a proposal more akin to his '80s middle school characters.  END
BEGIN HERE "I was of course a bit nervous, as any man will admit, you never truly know what a woman is thinking. So as much as I assumed she would be happy and say 'yes,' there's always that insecure part of my brain that regresses immediately to my childhood and thought maybe not," the actor explained. "So I kinda chickened out and did a written proposal by writing a note with two check boxes — one for yes and the other for no," Feldman recounted. Anyone remember those stuffed in your locker? "Of course there was a ring in there with the note," Feldman clarified. Phew! You had us nervous there for a second, Feldman... END
BEGIN HERE Which box did Feldman's sweetheart end up checking, you ask? "Luckily she said 'yes!'" he said. "She was very surprised, excited, and started crying. She was surprised because we had both been so anti-marriage since we met." So after four years together, what caused their change of heart? The United States' new president-elect. END
BEGIN HERE "Seeing as she's Canadian and with [Donald] Trump coming in, we didn't want to risk being separated by new immigration laws," Feldman explained. "We both know that we make a good team, and don't want to be separated  for any reason. So this is the best decision to protect our relationship." END
BEGIN HERE After news of their engagement broke, the star gave some hint as to their quick walk down the aisle. "We are planning a small, secret wedding just for family, very soon," he divulged. "We will likely have a big public wedding for friends and media to attend within a year." Looks like that happened sooner rather than later! END

BEGIN HERE Now that fall is in full swing, we’re loving all of the creative ways couples are incorporating autumnal details into their wedding celebration. From bright-orange pumpkins lining the ceremony aisle to bouquets and centerpieces in richly hued shades of burgundy, red, mustard yellow, and orange, its no wonder fall is one of the most popular times of the year to tie the knot. END
BEGIN HERE One of our favorite autumn-inspired wedding ideas? Celebrating the season’s bounty of fall fruit by offering an apple cider bar at your wedding reception. If the forecast calls for cooler temps, help guests warm up by setting up a drink station with mugs and beverage dispensers full of piping hot apple cider — your guests will appreciate such a thoughtful touch. Another idea? Serve up glasses of freshly pressed apple cider at cocktail hour or on the dessert table alongside sugared cider donuts — it really doesn’t get more “fall” than that.

BEGIN HERE If you and your fiancé’s idea of a perfect romantic getaway is to jump in the car and head to the great outdoors, we've got you covered. Cue roaring bonfires, S’mores, and major cozy time with your beau, and you have a recipe for some happy campers. Adding outdoor gear to your wedding registry is an obvious choice for couples that prefer hiking to hosting cocktail parties (not that you have to choose). But with so many products on the market these days, how do you know which things are indispensable (hint: coffee falls into this category) and which ones you can leave behind? Whether you’re brand new to camping or a pair of seasoned outdoor adventurers, these products will make you want to book that next camping trip right now.   END

A hammock at your campsite is just the thing to make you you sit back, relax and feel totally at home. ($70, Eno available at L.L.Bean) END
BEGIN HERE There’s a lot to keep in mind when wording your wedding invitation. Who is hosting (read: paying)? How formal is it? What type of event are you having? The list goes on. For a same-sex wedding invitation, is the format any different? Our experts weigh in. END
BEGIN HERE Great news! When it comes to your invitation wording, the rules are almost exactly the same for same-sex couples as they are for straight couples. The only major difference between wording the invitation for a same-sex wedding and a straight wedding is which person’s name to put first, though that’s easy to navigate.  END
BEGIN HERE For a straight couple, the bride’s name usually appears first. That’s because the bride’s family traditionally pays for the wedding, so formal invitations often begin with the bride’s parents’ names, requesting guests to join them as their daughter marries their future son-in-law. For a same-sex couple, if one set of parents is paying for the wedding, their child’s name should appear first. If both of your parents are contributing, or you’re paying for the wedding yourself, it’s up to you how you list your names — just be sure to mention both sets of parents on the invitation if they’re writing any of the checks. You could go alphabetically, or if you’re always known as “Jess and Susan” instead of “Susan and Jess,” use whatever sounds best to you!  END
BEGIN HERE Because same-sex marriage is legal in all 50 states (yay!), you can stick with tradition and invite guests to your marriage, or opt for different language (like “union”) that feels like it speaks more to your relationship.  END
BEGIN HERE Everything else will depend on the type of wedding you’re having, whether it’s in a house of worship or a secular venue, and if you want to include the reception information on the same card or on an insert (which is a matter of invitation style, as well as a common practice for particularly formal invitations.

He probably doesn’t share your concern over whether the table linens classify as “white” or “ivory,” or obsess over the seating chart until one o'clock in the morning. But that’s not to say he doesn’t care or isn’t paying attention. While more and more grooms are (thankfully) becoming involved in wedding planning, they still operate by a different set of rules and choose to expend energy on different things. So we asked Jeff Wilser, founding editor of the Plunge — a site where guys can go for the full rundown on all things grooms — to give us a little insight on what exactly he is stressing over, and how you can help him solve each of those dilemmas. END
BEGIN HERE    Maybe he’s self-motivated to do this already, but if not, kindly suggest that he take the initiative and talk to your parents about their expectations. Patricia Rossi, etiquette coach and author of Everyday Etiquette, says: “Try questions like ‘Is there anything I can work on to be the best husband for your daughter?’” Scary conversation? Potentially. But it opens a dialogue to preemptively avoid conflict — an investment that will pay dividends for decades.  END
BEGIN HERE And the same applies for the dynamic between you and his parents, because guess what? Weddings — and marriage — are a team effort. END
BEGIN HERE Lizzie Carlino and Brendon Boyea celebrated their 10 year anniversary with a “staycation” in New York City. While on a walk through Central Park, Brendon surprised Lizzie with a quartet playing their song and an unforgettable proposal. Their families even watched from afar at the Central Park Loeb Boathouse, where everyone then celebrated the couple's newly-minted engaged status with dinner and drinks. END
BEGIN HERE Two years later, the pair traded in the busy city for Palm Beach and invited 160 guests to join them for a ceremony and reception at The Sailfish Club of Florida on April 23, 2016. The Sailfish Club was an easy choice for this couple, as the bride's grandfather has been a member for fifteen years, and her father for three. “The perfect ‘Palm Beach pool party’ began to take shape over an outdoor lunch next to the pool with gorgeous views of the Intracoastal Highway,” Lizzie says. With planners at Posh Parties in their corner, this couple put together a celebration that felt like a vintage pool party complete with banana leaf prints, flamingo figurines, and tropical-inspired décor. Jessica Bordner Photography was behind the camera, and we certainly think you should check out the shots below. END
BEGIN HERE The bride and groom invited guests to Palm Beach with a welcome box filled with goodies to help them get through the weekend, including a mini cocktail kit, medicine, bandages, and sweets. END
BEGIN HERE Despite her career in the fashion industry, Lizzie admits that she found the dress-shopping experience difficult and exhausting. “There were so many beautiful dresses. It was hard to trust which was the right one,” she says. The final choice was an Inbal Dror blush organza wedding dress with white lace and beaded embroidery. END
BEGIN HERE She also wore white crystal strap Vince Camuto heels, Kate Spade earrings, and added a blush organza train. Lizzie’s bouquet featured soft pink peonies with greenery, playing off the couple's pink, green, and gold color scheme. END
BEGIN HERE Brendon wore a custom navy blue suit with pink stitching and a blush tie, which he paired with a tan belt and shoes. He also wore a gold  leather watch, a gift from his bride on the morning of the wedding. For some Palm Beach flair, Brendon even finished his look with flamingo cufflinks and socks. END
BEGIN HERE Lizzie’s mom and two sisters served as her bridesmaids, and she wanted to make sure each woman was entirely comfortable on the big day, so she asked them each to choose something in a neutral color scheme. Brendon's groomsmen chose their own navy suits and paired them with blush ties and the same belt and shoes as the groom. The couple’s adorable puggle, Miley, wore a collar of fresh flowers. END
BEGIN HERE Since the bride and groom had already thrown an island reggae welcome party to kick off their wedding weekend, they chose to keep their ceremony short and to the point. “We wanted our guests to mingle however they pleased and to feel as relaxed and at home in Palm Beach as we always do,” Lizzie says. As the pair exchanged vows at the altar, guests watched on from hightop tables, benches, or on the venue’s patio above. END
BEGIN HERE At the reception, the décor was purposefully selected to be both vibrant and fun. Banana leaf printed table runners, pink silk napkins, gold pineapples, tiki torches, and inflatable pink flamingos floating around the pool embodied Lizzie and Brendon's vision of a vintage pool party. The pair even hired a DJ (who was accompanied by a fusion band!) to get the party started. END
BEGIN HERE Guests enjoyed rum punches and mojitos, the couple’s two signature cocktails, and grabbed some food at a buffet that included a seafood bar, grilling station, pasta, and salad. They also had tons of dessert options, including ice cream sundaes, cookies, and bread pudding, along with the couple’s wedding cake — a simple buttercream frosted confection topped with bride and groom clay flamingos. END
BEGIN HERE The newlyweds couldn’t have asked for a better way to celebrate their nuptials with friends and family. “Having a destination wedding gave us the opportunity to plan multiple events for our guests,” Lizzie says. “Not only did we not have to spend half of our wedding day greeting people, we also didn’t feel the pressure to have one perfect day.  We had three!” END

BEGIN HERE It's official, you guys! One year and one day ago today, one of the best looking duos in Hollywood tied the knot on November 22, 2015. Sofia Vergara and Joe Manganiello have officially just hit the one year mark on their marriage and apparently are still cruising along the honeymoon phase!  END
BEGIN HERE To celebrate their first wedding anniversary, the couple took to Instagram to throw it back to the day they said "I do." That's right — Vergara and Manganiello just released some never-before-seen wedding photos! So if you thought we were done oohing and aahing over the bride's sultry wedding dress or the couple's flower-filled ceremony, hate to break it you, but you were sorely mistaken! END
BEGIN HERE A year ago, Vergara and Manganiello — along with a small, casual guest list of 400 family and friends — descended upon Palm Beach, Florida for their wedding weekend at The Breakers Resort. The celebration kicked off with pre-wedding parties that included private bungalows by the pool and extravagant dinners, complete with the cutest custom napkins that read "He had me at hola." And then, in a room where white blooms filled the space from floor to ceiling (seriously, it was like a damn forest in there in case you don't recall...), the Modern Family star, wearing a curve-hugging Zuhair Murad wedding dress, finally said "I do" to the Magic Mike hunk. Can you blame these two for wanting to relive that fairytale? (That very, very expensive fairytale...) END
BEGIN HERE To mark one year since their happily ever after, the couple shared a too-cute anniversary cake featuring a likeness of the duo — and indulged in a bit of throwback with some never-before-seen wedding pics! Manganiello posted a wedding snapshot of himself dancing with his brand new bride at their reception. "Feliz primer aniversario al amor de mi vida," he captioned the photo, meaning "Happy first anniversary to the love of my life." END
BEGIN HERE Vergara also sent us into a tizzy, posting some new photos from their 2015 big day, including another one of her and her hubby getting down on the dance floor, their itty bitty flower girls, and a black-and-white snapshot of the newlyweds walking back up the aisle, post-"I do."  END

BEGIN HERE 'Tis the season to be thankful. And when you count your blessings this Thanksgiving, our experts say you should be sure to focus in on gratitude as a couple.  END
BEGIN HERE "It's easy to complain and point fingers," admits relationship expert April Masini, "but it's more productive to create an atmosphere of gratitude and positivity."  END
BEGIN HERE Why? As Jane Greer, Ph.D., relationship expert and author of What About Me? Stop Selfishness From Ruining Your Relationship, explains, "Focusing on gratitude gives you a feeling of appreciation and love for your partner." What's more, "it helps you value and respect the relationship you have with each other," she says.  END
BEGIN HERE Not sure where to start? Here are seven things our experts say you should be thankful for as a couple.   END
BEGIN HERE    Calling all #powercouples: "Whether they're material successes, personal bests, career goals met or some other type of success you've achieved with the help of your partner or because you had the emotional health that your partner provides for you, be grateful," says Masini. "Success can be measured by so many different yardsticks — it's important to appreciate all your successes at this time of year." END
BEGIN HERE The winning look on Naeem Khan’s bridal runway this fall? Thigh-high stiletto bridal boots. Created by Naeem Khan and Christian Louboutin, this killer footwear brought an unexpected twist to Khan’s collection, begging us to ask — is this the next wedding fashion trend? Because there’s just something about miles of white backed by that trademark red heel that we can’t get enough of. END
BEGIN HERE Paired with knee-length wedding dresses, each set of boots are delicately embroidered and jeweled in their own right, infused with their own sense of style. The more opulent and gracefully beaded set complemented a sparkling modern lace mini dress with beaded fringe for a refined Studio 54 vibe while the second set, adorned with floral appliques for a bit more flair, were worn under a feminine fit and flare cocktail dress with similar floral embroidery, opposite a floor-length veil. END
BEGIN HERE Chic? We think so. Rife with texture, these wedding day boots are fashion-forward and have a bit of edge. They’re perfect for a seasonal transition, such as winter to spring when you’re still stuck in the harbor of cold and warmth, seeking a more bare and flirty style but still trying to protect yourself from the lingering chill.  END
BEGIN HERE  6 Tricks to Keep Your Wedding Shoes From Killing Your Feet END
BEGIN HERE Of course, the best way to flaunt this look is underneath a short hemline, as Khan paired it with — when you ditch tradition, you should really go all out! But we’d also love to see a waterfall hemline frame a pair of wedding day boots for a fun peek-a-boo effect. Perhaps with the advent of the pantsuit, we’ll soon start to see short rompers for the big day — and if we do, we know we’ll want to see a pair of knee-high boots right along with it. END
BEGIN HERE No matter which way they’re worn, there’s no denying the look is modern with a slightly urban feel — and it takes a bold bride who owns her style to pull it off. END
BEGIN HERE Would you wear wedding boots like these down the aisle? END
BEGIN HERE When Adrienne Bailon tied the knot earlier this month in an ultra-glam Parisian wedding, we couldn't take our eyes off of the B-E-A-UTIFUL bride in her super stunning Walter Mendez wedding dress. We mean, come on! Would you look at that thing?! In case you managed to miss it, The Real co-host wed her sweetheart, Grammy-winning Christian musician Israel Houghton, in a glitzy gown that totally stole the show. In Bailon's wedding photos, the fantastic frock nearly outdid the Eiffel Tower when it comes to sparkle, for goodness sake! And the sultry mermaid silhouette fit her curves to a tee. So how did Bailon prepare for that figure-hugging frock? Here's how she whipped her bod into wedding-ready shape! END
BEGIN HERE We can all pretty much agree that no bride should ever feel pressure to lose weight for her wedding day, but everyone wants to look and feel their very best when they say "I do" and celebs are no exception! So when Bailon became a bride, she kicked her workout routine and diet into high gear.  END
BEGIN HERE "Her goal was to get down to her usual weight," the star's trainer, Massy Arias, dished to E! News. "A lot of people don't know this, but she's very tiny, she's 4'9," she explained. "She's always had her goal weight in mind so she wanted to get back to a weight that she was comfortable with prior to gaining a few pounds." END
BEGIN HERE So what was this bride's wedding workout plan?  END
BEGIN HERE "She works out with me three to four times a week then she does homework that I give her at home, so five days a week total. 90 minutes total per day — 30 minutes of cardio on her own in the morning and then one hour with me. That hour was maximized because our training would be divided into circuits and there was no resting time or breaks in between," Bailon's expert trainer explained.  END
BEGIN HERE And that's not all. (Wedding weight loss is serious business, y'all!) The Real star also adjusted her diet to suit her new healthier lifestyle. According to Arias, Bailon would both start and finish her day with a plant-based protein drink and eat a healthy meals in-between. She loves poke salads as well as eggs and avocado toast. She'd also eat yogurt and cashews for a pre-workout snack," Arias shared.  END
BEGIN HERE Bailon's big no-nos? "No alcohol and no diary allowed," said her trainer, revealing that her client shed the weight by "eating the right food, eating the right amount of food, and just making sure we were hitting our goals every time." END
BEGIN HERE  Which Is Better For Weight Loss: Cardio Or Weights? END
BEGIN HERE "No shortcuts, no trends, or waist trainers. Nothing crazy. It was done with good exercise and good eating," she said. Kudos, Bailon! That's the way to do it! END
BEGIN HERE So what was Bailon's overall weight loss? According to Arias, over the two months before her big day, Bailon managed to lose a total of 22 lbs. And her now-hubby — who was shedding for the wedding right alongside his bride — lost 25 lbs. END
BEGIN HERE Hey, the couple who works out together, stays together! END
BEGIN HERE It goes without saying that you should be on your best behavior when you are a houseguest at your in-laws' homes. No matter what sort of snarky remarks you may have made to your besties about your new in-laws (and that extended family), you are a part of their family now, and you want to make a good impression. Or at the very least, not leave them with a bunch of snarky things to say about you after you've gone. If you plan to have children, you're setting the tone for many years of future holidays, and you want them to be something you look forward to, not dread. END
BEGIN HERE Sounds like common sense, right? So it should be easy? Maybe not. Every family is different, and we've all been raised with different manners and behavioral expectations. Some adults revert to childhood behaviors when they go home — letting mom pick up after them, and do their laundry, for example — but that doesn't fly once you're married, especially if it's not your own parents' house.  END
BEGIN HERE Here are some tips to make sure you don't become the dreaded holiday houseguest: END
BEGIN HERE    Even if you usually swear like a sailor and express your opinions freely in front of your husband's parents, tone it down when you're their houseguest, especially if they're entertaining a larger group. You do not want to embarrass them, or yourself. Listen to the words they use in front of their neighbors and extended family, and adjust your mouth accordingly. Be especially careful around new nieces and nephews — not just avoiding inappropriate words, but also inappropriate subject matter. This year's election, for example, invites a lot of different topics that really aren't best discussed in front of a younger audience.  END

BEGIN HERE The holidays are a time to fill your home with the people you love, sounds of laughter, and delicious smells that won't let anyone stray too far from the kitchen. And while so much of what makes the holidays special is that intangible feeling, having the right tools to bring it all together is important, too! While many couples today are opting for a wedding registry that's more practical and skipping things like cut crystal or fine china, that doesn't mean you can't add on a few items that will get your home ready for the season. We've rounded up some wedding registry must-haves that will make holiday entertaining even easier, from fantastic finds you'll love year-round to those special pieces you'll only use once a year. Happy holidays! END
BEGIN HERE    Scatter these throughout your home, or cluster them together on your table for a chic and minimalist centerpiece. ("Mercury Moonglow" candle, from $18.00, Illume available at Anthropologie) END
BEGIN HERE There are so many perks to creating an online wedding registry, from skipping the in-store headache to letting guests shop even if they don’t have a store nearby to allowing you to manage your wedding gifts (and your thank you notes!) instantly. Another? Getting notified when gifts have been purchased and shipped, so you can send thank you notes promptly. However, sometimes that item you love isn’t in stock, and the notification is for a gift that is backordered. When should you send a thank you note? Our experts have the answer. END
BEGIN HERE The timing of thank you notes is a hot topic. Yes, you technically have a few months after the wedding to sit down, crank them out, and put them in the mail, but why sign yourself up for hand cramps when you can tackle the pile slowly, before it gets out of control? Sending thank you notes as soon as gifts arrive is the best way to stay organized and be efficient.  END
BEGIN HERE If you’ve been notified of a gift that won’t actually ship for a while, remember that your guest was sent that notification, too. They won’t be surprised if they don’t hear from you soon, because they know you haven’t gotten the gift yet — and will likely receive another notification when the gift actually ships! So don’t worry about sending a thank you note until the item in question arrives at your door.  END
BEGIN HERE Do, however, keep an eye out: If the gift becomes unavailable, or the item is discontinued, it’s worth sending your guest an email. Let them know you saw that they’d purchased you a gift, and that you wanted to make sure they saw that it won’t be coming after all — this way they can be sure to get their money back!  END
BEGIN HERE When the gift does arrive, whether it’s just before your wedding or in the weeks or months after, send your thank you note as soon as possible, so they know you’ve finally received it.  END
BEGIN HERE  How to Regift Your Wedding Presents — Without Getting Caught END
BEGIN HERE It can be tricky to be a groom. Many moons ago, the lines of responsibilities were nice and clear (albeit rather sexist and unfair): The bride did most of the wedding planning work, and the groom nodded and tried to stay out of trouble. Happily, things have changed. More and more couples are working together to plan their weddings, tackling problems as a team, and jointly pulling off one hell of a party.  END
BEGIN HERE That said, I’m guessing your fiancé does not subscribe to Grooms magazine. He has not fantasized about the wedding since he was a little boy. He’s not scouring Pinterest for inspiration. And, OK, real talk? He’s a little lost. He has asked himself questions like “Where do I even begin?” and “What’s my job exactly?” and “Wait, wedding cakes cost what?!”  END
BEGIN HERE Before you launch into wedding planning mode, he needs to be brought up to speed. First, candidly discuss a division of labor. Explain which tasks you’re excited to tackle, figure out where he could add the most value, then divvy up the boring to-dos you both want to avoid. Second, let him know that some aspects of planning require a true partnership — namely: the When, the Where, and the Who. Let him know that with these three major tasks you need and expect his help ... and then it’s cool if he wants to doze off at the florist. Here’s how to incorporate him fully in each of the “Big 3.” END
BEGIN HERE    Your guest list is like the global supply of crude oil: Its supply and demand will drive every cost of the global economy (your wedding), it’s contested by every superpower (the parents), and it can trigger wars and bloodshed (fights with your mom and bridesmaids). Here, he needs to have your back. When crafting your guest list, use the rule of thirds; if you’re paying, that’s a third of the list for the bride, a third for the groom, and a third for the parents. Don’t be afraid to exclude coworkers (they’ll get over it), and know that it’s OK to be stingy with plus-ones. A good rule of thumb: If neither of you has spoken to certain people on the list in the last year, cut ’em. They won’t exactly be heartbroken and might not even notice.  END
BEGIN HERE If you find him giving you flack even after you’ve explained the importance of the Big 3, try getting him to think as if you’re planning a vacation. For a lot of guys, even the words “wedding planning” have loaded connotations; if you orient your to-dos as you would with a vacation, it suddenly sounds like fun! And like any vacation, a wedding can involve some drudgery (invoices), some drama (new in-laws), and some headaches (the guest list), but it also has a glorious payoff. And this is a sun-kissed vacation that lasts forever. So make it a good one. END

Think sparkly rings and bending down on one knee... Yes, you guessed it, engagement season has arrived! And while the holidays are actually a slower time for weddings (although we do love those festive winter weddings!), it is by far the most popular time for engagements. END

Plus, your families will most likely already be in town so spreading the news makes everything a lot simpler.  END
BEGIN HERE So, if think your special someone may be popping that particular question, or if you yourself are doing the asking, then there’s a lot to get done. Between figuring out how to go about proposing to what you might say, there can be a lot of pressure. The most important? Figuring out what engagement ring to buy.

BEGIN HERE It's been almost an entire year since Miley Cyrus brought her 2012 engagement ring back out of retirement. The singer has been rocking her bridal bling from Liam Hemsworth since January, but revealed only last month that she's actually not as crazy in love with her ring as she is with her Australian sweetheart. (Insane, right?) Well, Hemsworth must have gotten the memo because he just gifted Cyrus a brand new bit of bling for the star's birthday — and it's even bigger than the first one he gave her if you could believe it! What's a girl gotta do to get this lucky? END
BEGIN HERE Last month, Cyrus appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show where she revealed that her engagement ring just isn't her style. "Most of my jewelry is made out of gummy bears and cotton candy," she shared. "This isn't really my aesthetic but I'll wear it because you love me," Cyrus said she tells Hemsworth. While we can't fathom how anyone could not love that dreamy Neil Lane engagement ring with its cushion-cut diamond and 18K gold band, Hemsworth apparently took the hint. Cyrus' 24th birthday fell on the day before Thanksgiving this year and it looks like she had a lot to be thankful for, as the Hunger Games star gifted her an extra sparkly present! END
BEGIN HERE "Happiest birthday to my favorite little angel!" Hemsworth adorably wrote on Instagram, captioning a photo of Cyrus holding a wrapped box, all decked out in shiny stickers and kitschy cutouts. What's inside, you wonder?

BEGIN HERE Everyone wants to make a good impression on a first date, but for Caroline Scholes and David Eshelman, the stakes were a little higher. “David saw a picture of me with a mutual friend and asked to meet me,” Caroline says. “He flew into San Antonio, Texas, and took me on a dinner date. The next day he left to be deployed for three years.” Talk about pressure! Luckily, as an F18 TOPGUN fighter pilot, David clearly has nerves of steel, so one date was all it took to know they had found something special. After enduring three deployments and a very long-distance relationship, the two got engaged in Tokyo during a break in David's 2015 deployment, proving that some couples are simply meant to be. “He took me to an island overlooking the night skyline of Tokyo and got down on one knee and asked me to be his wife!” END
BEGIN HERE After beating impossible odds, the two were ready for a big celebration, and the Drake Hotel in Chicago, Illinois, was the perfect place to host the culmination of their fairy-tale romance. On October 17, 2015, 250 family members and friends were there to support the couple as they said “I do,” while Julia Dragomir of You Me Photography captured every last important moment.  END
BEGIN HERE With Kate Middleton as her bridal inspiration there was no way Caroline's look could go wrong — even if her first shopping trip didn’t go as smoothly as planned. “I was slightly disappointed because I had a vision in my head of what I wanted my wedding dress to look like and wasn’t able to find it. It wasn’t until my mom and I went downtown dress shopping, just the two of us, that we found the dress together. We both fell in love with the dress immediately,” she says.  END
BEGIN HERE Her Pronovias wedding dress proved a bride really can have it all in one style. Caroline's gown combined delicate lace and silk to create a timeless look for this elegant bride. The empire waist dress originally came with sleeves but Caroline had them removed and instead wore a custom-made lace bolero for the ceremony. END
BEGIN HERE She accessorized with a floor-length veil and the garter her grandmother wore 63 years prior on her wedding day. While the bride started the day in sparkly heels, she later changed into cowboy boots — the same beloved pair she wore on her first date with David. We adore how these kinds of personal details were incorporated throughout the day. Even with 250 guests, these two found a way to keep their love at the center of it all. END
BEGIN HERE With her princess-worthy wedding dress found, Caroline and her seven bridesmaids continued the day’s regal theme by getting ready in the Princess Diana suite. But the morning’s outfits weren’t just for a cute photo op: “Since David was stationed in Japan while we were dating, part of the bridesmaids’ gift were navy robes with a kimono feel,” Caroline says. Once beautified, the bridesmaids changed into classic floor-length navy gowns that one of Caroline's own attendants had suggested. Talk about being a go-to girl! END
BEGIN HERE While the bride always steals the show when it comes to the day-of fashion, this groom certainly held his own. Dressed in traditional military uniforms, David and his groomsmen carried swords instead of boutonnieres — an accessory, that surprisingly enough, came in handy later on.   END
BEGIN HERE Designed in gothic revival style, Chicago’s Fourth Presbyterian Church served as a gorgeous location for the couple to exchange vows. Light poured in from large stained glass windows as Caroline walked down the 332-foot aisle with her father. She carried an all-white bouquet of roses and lilies, the first flower her groom had given her when they started dating. A string quartet played "Canon in D" during the processional, and guests got a glimpse of our favorite ceremony detail: a misty-eyed groom. END
BEGIN HERE With all the sacrifice of being a military couple comes some well-deserved perks, like a spectacular exit from your ceremony.  After Caroline and David were pronounced husband and wife, all of the military personnel in attendance, including the groom’s father and brother, created a sword arch for the newlyweds as they emerged onto Michigan Avenue.  END
BEGIN HERE From there, the party headed just a few blocks over to The Drake Hotel, a city landmark that did not disappoint guests, who were greeted upon arrival by white-gloved butlers baring glasses of champagne. When it was time for the reception, everyone entered the Gold Coast Room; a massive, ornate ballroom with floor to ceiling windows overlooking Lake Michigan.  END
BEGIN HERE With dazzling chandeliers and gold trim throughout, the room was stunning. And with gold stripes on their uniforms, the groom and his fellow military men fit right in! Centerpieces contained various types of all-white flowers with trailing vines and greenery, alternating between high and low arrangements on each table. Candles were placed around the room and on the tables to add a warm glow that contrasted nicely against the glowing moon above Lake Michigan. END
BEGIN HERE After a steak and lobster tail entrée some guests may have been stuffed, but when it came time to select their desserts, this couple still went big. With options as fun as these, who could disagree? Guests chose between three options, each of which had special significance to the bride and groom. First up were mini mason jar apple pies inspired by the groom’s Nashville roots. Then, Auburn cookies as a nod to the groom’s alma mater. Finally, red, white, and blue macaroons were arranged as a perfectly patriotic treat. But it was the elegant three-tiered, monogrammed wedding cake that set the stage for an unforgettable moment as the bride and groom cut it with the sword from David’s uniform — a gift given to him by the oldest living naval aviator. END
BEGIN HERE As for advice for her fellow brides, Caroline had this bit of wisdom to impart. “Enjoy it! Everyone sees the wedding as the finish line but in actuality it’s the starting line for your marriage.”   END

BEGIN HERE More and more couples are ditching the classic white wedding cake, opting for other non-traditional-yet-still-delectable desserts like homemade pies, cupcakes, cake pops, and even giant Rice Krispies treats stacked like a cake. The latest wedding-dessert trend? The doughnut wall. That’s right — because nothing is sweeter that an entire wall decked out with doughnuts.  END
BEGIN HERE The doughy treats are affordable, easy to serve, and you can offer guests a variety of flavors (glazed! old fashioned! sprinkles!); not to mention the fact that doughnuts are simply downright adorable. And while you can certainly serve donuts instead of cake altogether, you could also offer donuts as a part of a larger dessert-table spread. (Hey, where dessert’s concerned, we say the more the merrier!) END
BEGIN HERE Bonus: Doughnut walls (a genius concept originally created by famed caterer Peter Callahan) can also double as reception décor. I mean, just think of the Instagram potential! So if you’re planning a wedding, consider skipping the photo booth and just have your guests pose for pics in front of the doughnut wall.  END

BEGIN HERE Doesn't it seem that from the moment you got engaged to even after you walked down the aisle, nearly everyone around you has some words of wisdom, advice, or suggestions for your big day? While it's all usually good-natured and with the best intentions, it can seem a bit overwhelming. It turns out, there's actually really great advice out there from brides who have been there, done that — you just have to listen. We asked real brides to pass along the best advice they received before their big day.  END
BEGIN HERE    "Plan for the marriage, not the wedding. It's a simple saying but it means a lot. Planning for your life together and not a single day is often forgotten." —ChrisAnn, 38 (October 2008) END
BEGIN HERE Most people don't like to talk about money — even with their spouses. But, if you don't open up to your partner about money, you could be opening up your marriage to trouble. "Ask anyone and they'll tell you that honesty and trust are the foundations of a successful relationship," says Elle Kaplan, finance expert and founder of LexION Capital. "It might not sound romantic initially, but much of this mutual faith is connected to your finances. Everything from wanting a child to retiring together requires not only emotional but also financial transparency."  END
BEGIN HERE Some money secrets are especially dangerous, too. Here are three that our experts say you should never keep from one another.  END
BEGIN HERE    A credit score may just be three little numbers, but it packs a big punch. "They can be a major roadblock for the most important purchases in your marriage," says Kaplan. Imagine how unhappy your spouse will be if they find out your score isn't high enough to qualify for a home mortgage only after you've found your dream home.  END
BEGIN HERE "While you may want to keep this number to yourself, the moment you try to apply for a joint auto loan or mortgage, the truth will come out and one of you could end up costing the two of you hundred if not thousands of dollars in additional interest," says Storjohann. The good news is that credit scores can improve with time and good financial habits. And your partner can help you figure out the habits that will boost yours even higher. END
BEGIN HERE You've probably wandered into at least one bridal store since getting engaged. Maybe you've sifted through the wedding dresses of a dozen stores while window shopping for your dream dress. Unless you've been employed by a bridal gown retailer, though, chances are you aren’t fully aware of what happens behind the scenes that may affect you as a buyer. To help give you the scoop, we spoke to people who've been there and done that. END
BEGIN HERE     Don't take that price tag at face value. Markups on wedding dresses is a real thing, and sometimes the markups are quite high. For example, Reid says that a dress that costs $500 to $700 wholesale may be marked up to $1500 or $1800 once it hits the sales floor.  END
BEGIN HERE "One great way to begin this process is by name-dropping the boutiques other local rivalries and tell them that you were at said store earlier and they had it, for example, $1500 compared to the price of $1800 you're currently staring at," says Reid. "I've never known a store to not price-match, as long as it's a brick and mortar." END
BEGIN HERE With guests traveling from near and far to join in the wedding festivities, it’s no surprise that most couples hope they’ll be able to greet each and every person at some point during their wedding day. But with tight timelines, big emotions, and guest lists soaring over 100 people, it can feel like there aren’t enough minutes in the day. Is there a way to make the rounds and spend a moment or two with every one of your guests? Our experts have a few tips. END
BEGIN HERE First things first: Toss out that old standby, the receiving line. “They’re dated, create a traffic jam at the exit of your ceremony or the entrance to the reception, and can really kill the mood for guests who are stuck waiting,” says (Mindy Weiss)[http://mindyweiss.com/”], celebrity wedding planner and and (Wedding Paper Divas Style Partner)[https://www.weddingpaperdivas.com/promo/mindyweiss.htm”]. “But that doesn’t mean you can’t find a way to connect with each of your guests and thank them for joining you on your big day.” Weiss encourages her clients to make the rounds from table to table, instead. Of course, finding time to eat dinner and enjoy your own party is of paramount importance, so follow her easy advice: END
BEGIN HERE “Break up your visiting by stopping at just a few tables at a time. You’ll be able to say hello while still enjoying the early parts of the festivities,” Weiss says. “Begin during the first course, but pause every few tables to get on the floor for early dance sets or to sit down and have a bite to eat. Then head back out to the tables to continue saying hello.”  END
BEGIN HERE It’s never ideal, but be prepared to not have a chance to eat an entire meal. Instead, ask your caterer to plate your dinner early, either skipping the salad course and going straight for the entrées or sneaking off during cocktail hour for an early dinner. “You could also ask your caterer to pack up your meals so you can indulge in them later, when you’re finally relaxed,” says Weiss. While your guests are having their entrées, before it’s time for the first dance or to cut the cake, continue to make the rounds. Then, if there’s anyone you missed, be sure to seek them out on the dance floor!  END
BEGIN HERE  What to Look For in a Wedding Planner END
BEGIN HERE What's more gorgeous than a wedding reception with tables overflowing with stunning flowers? How about those same incredible flowers but, instead of draped on the table, they're dangling from the ceiling! Overhead floral arrangements are the next big thing in wedding design, from floral chandeliers over the dance floor to artful installments of greenery spanning the length of the head table. But as you've probably guessed, there's a lot more to it than just tying some fishing line to a few blooms and calling it a day! So we've asked Bronwen Smith, lead designer and owner of B Floral in New York City, to give us the inside scoop on how it's really done.  END
BEGIN HERE "To add an elegant touch to a simple chandelier, incorporate delicate yet structured flowers, like orchids," says Smith. "Drape them carefully so they flow naturally throughout the arms of the fixture." She uses thin floral wire to secure the stems to the chandelier without distracting from the lush blooms.  END
BEGIN HERE Looking for a serious "wow" factor? "If part of your venue is more simple, dress it up with an elaborate hanging floral installation," Smith describes. Here, she built a modern wooden frame, with mesh stretched across it, to hang in the lounge area. She then strung eucalyptus and long-stemmed blooms, as well as clematis, from the mesh to create a robust statement piece.  END
BEGIN HERE If your style is more whimsical, floral garlands are your best friend. "String delicate blooms of varying sizes, like these soft pink garden roses and ranunculus, for a soft garland. Use clear fishing line and a thick, sturdy needle to thread your blooms straight through the center (with the petals all pointing the same direction) and knot them off at different heights," Smith explains. "Then drape the garlands behind your altar or throughout your venue."  END
BEGIN HERE  17 Amazing Suspended-Greenery Installations for Your Wedding END
BEGIN HERE Since this is a big departure from a standard centerpiece, there are a few logistical and budget-related things to keep in mind. First, says Smith: "Never underestimate the weight of the flowers! If you need to water-pick your flowers [those plastic tubes some blooms are tucked into], it will add significant weight to your hanging installment." Some can be arranged directly in floral foam (which, again, will be soaked in water and will be heavy), while other, hardier varieties may be able to last all night without a water source. "Always check with your venue first to see where you will be able to hang our installation. There might be restrictions, so where you can place the hanging elements will affect your overall design," Smith explains.  END
BEGIN HERE You should also talk budget with your florist before you get too attached. "Because hanging installations usually require a custom frame or structure, prices tend to be higher," Smith explains. "And because they are fresh and usually free-standing instead of in a vase or vessel, much of the work is done on-site." That could add to your floral budget because it requires additional labor. "However, if you're looking for a real show-stopper, a hanging arrangement can be priceless!" END
BEGIN HERE Often referred to as the "Chicago Loop" by native Chicago residents, the bustling downtown metropolitan area of the windy city is filled with some of the city's coolest tourist attractions and hidden landmarks. We've gathered a list of some of Chicago's most celebrated florists to help aid in the process of finding a floral arrangement that suits you and your budding wedding style.  END
BEGIN HERE We definitely know what these two were thankful for this year! Mark Ballas and BC Jean not only celebrated their Thanksgiving weekend with the traditional family dinner, but with a wedding! The Dancing with the Stars pro and his songwriter sweetheart tied the knot on Friday in Malibu, California, and we have all the details! END
BEGIN HERE After getting engaged the day before Thanksgiving last year, Ballas and Jean have officially come full circle, saying their "I dos" the day after Thanksgiving on November, 25. (Wedding dress after pumpkin pie? Sure, why not?) According to Us Weekly, the wedding took place at Calamigos Ranch with tons of Dancing with the Stars alum in attendance. Julianne Hough, Brittany Cherry, Sharna Burgess, Keo Motsepe, Cheryl Burke, Sasha Farber, Emma Slater, and Jenna Johnson all scored guest list status, while Derek Hough served as best man. "It's Time!" Hough wrote on Instagram ahead of the ceremony, captioning a photo of a vintage-inspired pocket watch. END
BEGIN HERE When the time did arrive, the bride stunned in a beaded long sleeve wedding dress with open shoulders and a jeweled high neckline — so unique! Meanwhile, the groom looked dashing in a blue suit, complete with a newsboy cap and velvet bow tie. This couple is just too-cool, no? END
BEGIN HERE And from the reception photo booth snapshots and the fact that so many DWTS pros were cutting a rug on the dance floor, we have no doubts that this was quite the shindig! "Everybody was having a blast," a source shared with Us Weekly. "It was a fun day with a lot of love and emotion. There was lots of dancing, of course, and it was a great party." END
BEGIN HERE  Dancing With the Stars' Emma Slater Spills All the Details on Her Upcoming Wedding to Sasha Farber END
BEGIN HERE And the groom of course agrees! "It's a wild feeling," Ballas told People magazine of his and BC Jean's big day. "Your wedding is something you subconsciously prepare for your entire life. You wonder who it's going to be with, where it is going to be and how the ceremony and reception are going to be. Now it's finally here and happening. It's surreal. I just want to soak it all up because I just know I'm going to click my fingers and the whole evening will be over and I want to make sure I enjoy it." END
BEGIN HERE "I'm so grateful so many family and friends were able to travel here to celebrate our wedding," continued the dancing pro. "It's going to be a night of amazing moments." From the looks of these photos, it certainly was! END
BEGIN HERE What’s even better than meeting the love of your life at a concert on your college campus? How about having the lead singer of that same band perform the first dance song at your wedding? Seven years after Gabrielle Karol and Ben Jacobs met, they did just that. “Ben surprised me,” Gabrielle says. “The amount of planning it took — as well as the fact that everyone successfully kept it a secret! — was amazing.” It’s no secret, then, that the pair’s July 11, 2015, wedding at Tappan Hill Mansion in Tarrytown, New York, was a crazy-fun party full of equally sweet touches.  END
BEGIN HERE The pair fell for the venue’s patio overlooking the Hudson River, and decided to roll the dice and keep their fingers crossed for good weather. They got lucky, and exchanged vows just before the sun set over the river. Inside the venue, hundreds of string lights and the warm glow of candles dressed up the ballroom, where a romantic décor scheme of garden roses, hydrangeas, and thistles added softness to the space. This long-distance wedding (planned all the way from San Francisco!) was a real stunner: Check out the photos by Sara Wight Photography, below! END
BEGIN HERE We love a bride who loves to accessorize, and Gabrielle did just that, donning crystal-studded Jimmy Choo sandals that were a perfect match for her oval halo engagement ring. While she loved playing dress-up and exploring a variety of bridal styles, Gabrielle ended up falling for a classic lace trumpet gown from Anna Maier. “I wear a lot of white on a regular basis, and knew I wanted my wedding gown to be that same, pure color,” says the bride of choosing classic white over ivory or cream. END
BEGIN HERE The bride’s bouquet mixed cream and blush roses into a traditional pomander. She accented her side-swept chignon with a subtle hair pin, which she wore beneath a cathedral-length veil. END
BEGIN HERE Ben looked the part in a shawl-collar tuxedo from J.Crew, but was almost missing a key accessory: His shoes! “We realized that we’d forgotten his tuxedo shoes at home, and didn’t have time to turn around on our way to the airport,” says Gabrielle. What followed was a frantic call to New York stores, an order from Amazon that wound up being delayed, and (finally!) success at a small menswear store near the bride’s parents’ home. “We now have three pairs of size 13 tuxedo shoes, but luckily we can make some returns!”  END
BEGIN HERE Gabrielle and Ben had two adorable ring bearers. The first was the couple’s dog, Duke, who wore a tuxedo harness down the aisle alongside the bride’s cousin, Cole. “It felt a little crazy flying Duke cross-country for the wedding, but the photos of him in his tuxedo are some of our favorites,” Gabrielle says.  END
BEGIN HERE To match their soft blue Amsale dresses, the bridesmaids carried bouquets of peach and blush roses, accented with thistles and lamb’s ear.  END
BEGIN HERE Each ‘maid chose a different style of the gray-blue gown, while the groomsmen all wore black shawl-collar tuxedos to match Ben’s.  END
BEGIN HERE The ceremony took place overlooking the Hudson River, with an arch of curly willow branches draped in vines, hydrangeas, and roses. While the couple opted for traditional Jewish vows, they did choose a unique recessional song: “Want You Back” by the Jackson 5. “We broke up for a long time before getting back together, so it was the perfect choice,” says Gabrielle.  END
BEGIN HERE With views like this, it’s no wonder the pair was hoping for sunshine — and they got it in spades!  END
BEGIN HERE Dozens of strands of lights were draped across the venue’s ceiling, and the glow was enhanced by pillar candles and votives. Floating blooms added to the romance of each centerpiece, which mixed green hydrangeas and thistles with cream and peach garden roses. Each gold charger was topped with a folded napkin and a printed menu, finished with the couple’s monogram.  END
BEGIN HERE Before the dancing got underway, Ben and Gabrielle cut into their wedding cake, decorated with rough frosting and sugar flowers. Then it was time to party! “When we walked out for our first dance, I was shocked to see the lead singer of the band whose concert we met at,” says Gabrielle. “It’s one of my favorite memories.”  END
BEGIN HERE After a rousing rendition of the hora, the couple’s band, Luxe, had everyone grooving all night. “We ended up staying out until 3 a.m., eating pizza and smoking cigars. Then at 4:30, the hotel’s fire alarm went off! Thankfully it was a false alarm, because a lot of our friends slept straight through it,” the bride remembers. “But seeing those who did wake up make their way outside on so little sleep was pretty funny!”  END

BEGIN HERE  20 Ways to Throw the Best Wedding Ever END
BEGIN HERE With a fall wedding date, it should come as little surprise that Juliya and Jason wanted to embrace the best aspects of the wedding season during their day. Their color palette played off the changing leaves, meaning the bride carried a lush bouquet with pops of burgundy while her groom donned a cranberry-colored bow tie. We even love their harvest-inspired centerpieces, which included a mix of different in-season blooms, cut wood rounds, and lanterns filled with candles. END
BEGIN HERE Their reception was all about fun. With string lights covering every inch of the ceiling, guests danced beneath a glowing canopy and celebrated with the elated bride and groom well into the night. END
BEGIN HERE Everyone loves a good party (and an open bar!), but there’s a chance your guest list includes someone who has a tendency to overdo it occasionally. As the evening’s hosts, you’ll want to make sure every one of your wedding guests has a blast — and also doesn’t get out of hand and make the evening less enjoyable for the rest of your friends and family. So what steps can you take to make sure a guest who loves to drink doesn’t get, well, too drunk? Our experts weigh in. END
BEGIN HERE This is where having a great staff for your wedding can really come in handy. Before the big day arrives, it’s a good idea to walk your wedding planner through any sticky situations, from family tension to guests who are known to take “drunk” too far. Giving them a heads-up will help your planner keep an eye out for problems before they get too big, as well as share any important information with other vendors who will be around on your wedding day.  END
BEGIN HERE Let your caterer and the bartenders know who to keep an eye out for, as well. Whether serving drinks to the table or just the bar, they’ve usually got a keen eye for a guest who has had too much, and can help to cut them off (or at least slow them down), as well as make sure there’s a full glass of water nearby! END
BEGIN HERE Another great way to help curb any excessive drinking is to skip the shots altogether. Shots get guests drunk faster, and people often end up drinking more because, well, they’re so small. You’ll also go through the booze much faster, as it isn’t cut with mixers so guests will keep coming back. Instead, specify mixed drinks only. Many venues don’t allow shots, anyway, so you may not even have to make the call!  END
BEGIN HERE If you’re still concerned, consider recruiting a friend or family member of the guest in question to help keep an eye on them. While you don’t want anyone to have to spend the night babysitting, you should make sure someone is prepared to step in and take the guest in question home if they do end up having too much to drink.  END
BEGIN HERE  The Hard Truths of Wedding Planning END
BEGIN HERE When you think about adding bathroom items to your wedding registry, you most likely overlook the seemingly utilitarian “extras” that can add a lot more personality and charm to an oft-overlooked room.  Sure, a toilet paper holder may seem like an odd registry item, but what about a really beautiful one, say one made of brass in a sleek and modern design? You see it everyday why not make it special? Here, we’ve rounded up some of our favorite pieces for a room that, let’s be honest, you spend a fair amount of time in.   END
BEGIN HERE    For the couple that’s so over the all-white, or even just solid colored, bath towels everyone has, these printed and colorful towels from Dusen Dusen give your bathroom that extra pop that it was looking for. You can never step out of the shower anything but cheerful with these bad boys. (Set of 4 for $18, Dusen Dusen available at Zola) END
BEGIN HERE You can count on your hair and makeup team to think of almost everything: budge-proof mascara that won't run down your face while you read your vows, multiple curling iron wands to give you those coveted natural-looking waves, and hairspray that'll make your 'do last until that very last until the very last dance. But there's plenty of not-so-typical products that are just as essential to your beauty look that your glam squad might not have on hand, like frizz-defying hair sheets you can tuck into your clutch or an acne spot treatment for a last-minute stress zit. So we've put together a handy checklist of forget-me-not items to keep in your stash — and chances are you'll use them for way beyond your big day, too. END
BEGIN HERE    Make your hotel room or getting-ready location feel a little bit more warm and welcoming with a great-scented candle. This option from the editor-loved brand is housed in a handmade porcelain jar that's hand-dipped so that no two candles are exactly alike — a perfect, special option to be a part of your big day. ("La Madeleine" candle, $85, Diptyque available at Nordstrom) END
BEGIN HERE The only thing more exciting about wedding planning than shopping for a wedding dress is the big day itself! Whether you know exactly what wedding dress you want or are eager to try on just about anything, nailing down “The Dress” is a process. But what if you’ve brought your mom along as a trusted advisor, and you just can’t see eye to eye? Our experts have some advice to make the "wedding dress shopping with mom" experience a little easier. END
BEGIN HERE Finding a wedding dress you love is hard enough, and it’s even harder when your entourage isn’t on-board. If Mom isn’t loving anything you’ve tried, begin by figuring out what it is she doesn’t like. Too much cleavage? A shade of white she doesn’t think is flattering your coloring? Not enough bling? Narrow down what she’d love to see you in and, unless it’s something that would make you really uncomfortable, consider being open-minded and trying on a silhouette or style that you haven’t tried yet. You might just love it, or your mom might realize it’s not right for you. Be clear about what you do and don’t like about a dress, whether it’s the way the fabric feels against your skin or a body part you’d love to flaunt that you feel is being hidden instead. If you can both explain what you do and don’t like — instead of simply dismissing a style — you might have an easier time finding some common ground. Then recruit your consultant to do some legwork and find a dress that combines details you both love. END
BEGIN HERE Still butting heads, even with a huge range of gowns in the dressing room? Maybe it’s time to call it a day and make an appointment to come back. You could be facing dress fatigue, or your mom might not be the shopping partner for you.  END
BEGIN HERE If shopping alone isn’t for you, bring along a friend or other relative who has similar taste to yours (but will also be honest with you!). Or you could always go it alone and ask your consultant to help expand your horizons! Can’t bear to make the final decision without Mom? Narrow it down to your top contenders, then have her come back to the salon with you for one final appointment. Hopefully seeing you thrilled about the choices will help her get on-board! END

BEGIN HERE    LDRs come with their own jealousy issues. But when you live nearby, "new jealousies could arise, and close relationships with others could be questioned," says Coleman. For example, "if a partner spent a lot of time with a friend due to the long-distance relationship, that may be expected to change now that they have more time to be together." Coleman suggests sitting down to discuss boundaries before the big move. "Find ways to renegotiate those friend relationships so they don't become trigger points for stress and jealousy in the relationship," she says. END

"Score a deal on end of season styles when retailers are looking to make room for their next collections," she says. "June and November are usually the best times to score deals as previous seasons' dresses are often drastically discounted, so you may be able to purchase a designer dress for a fraction of the price."

BEGIN HERE "You've made the right choice in hiring a wedding planner, but just like your other vendors, you are still required to make all of the decisions and be present in the wedding planning process," says Amy Nichols, owner of Amy Nichols Special Events and co-founder of The Poppy Group. "Of course your planner will give you a lot of great advice and can save you time, but that doesn't mean your planner will now do everything wedding related."  END
BEGIN HERE And with that in mind, here are nine things you simply shouldn't expect them to do.  END
BEGIN HERE     Your wedding planner will (most likely) be happy to make sure your must-have items, such as table numbers and escort cards, arrive at your venue. "But this does not mean that planners should be expected to move those two huge floral urns from the church to the reception," says Nichols. Same goes for your wedding dress and personal heirlooms that must make it home at the end of the night. "As much as we would love to keep those personal items under our watchful eye, not every planner has the space to carry all of those things home at the end of the night," Nichols says. END

BEGIN HERE Mark Ballas sees his fair share of glitter on the sparkly minidresses of his Dancing with the Stars co-stars. But we think it's safe to say that the sparkle coming off of his Ballas' bride's wedding dress outdid nearly all of those on-screen frocks. On Friday, November 25, the DWTS pro wed his songwriter sweetheart, BC Jean, in a California ceremony, and — no surprise here — the pictures are super stunning. Thanksgiving may be over, but we're still thankful we get to ogle over these gorgeous wedding photos! END
BEGIN HERE According to Us Weekly, Ballas and BC Jean tied the knot at California's Calamigos Ranch with tons of Dancing with the Stars alum in attendance. Julianne Hough, Brittany Cherry, Sharna Burgess, Keo Motsepe, Cheryl Burke, Sasha Farber, Emma Slater, and Jenna Johnson all scored guest list status, while Derek Hough served as best man. And it seems that Hough was just as impressed with the big day details as we are! In fact, the groom's designated BFF took to Instagram post-"I dos" to gush over the newlyweds. "Such an honor to be the best man at my brothers wedding," Hough wrote on the 'Gram, captioning a lovey-dovey photo of the bride and groom. "Witnessing their love be sealed under a beautiful Oak tree in front of family friends was such a special moment. Like the tree May you Stand together tall and proud. May you always Go out on a limb for one another." END
BEGIN HERE The DWTS pro continued the sweet sentiment writing, "Stay grounded and dig your roots in deep so that you may weather any storm. And always continue to grow, stronger and higher reaching towards the heavens. And to always enjoy the view. Love you two." If this is the way Hough writes on social media, we can only imagine his best man speech! END

BEGIN HERE Most of us (sadly) hear about the pains of divorce all too often — whether it is affecting us personally or a family member. But what about the women and men who suffer from heartbreak before they even say their "I do's"? One of Hollywood's most beloved stars, Mariah Carey, is going through this very situation after calling off her engagement to James Packer recently. The "We Belong Together"singer is feeling a tidal wave of emotions during this difficult time, especially after seeing a trailer for her E! Entertainment docuseries called "Mariah's World" where she tries on glittery wedding dresses in front of the camera. Carey looks absolutely radiant in the trailer, sporting a V-neck, body-hugging gown and a veil that even gets us a little teary-eyed.  END
BEGIN HERE In a recent interview with Entertainment Tonight, the "Glitter" actress explained how she felt reliving those moments while watching her reality TV show's trailer. She told the celebrity news network, "All of those moments are bittersweet. But you just have to focus on whatever you're focusing on and keep it moving." It's a good motto in theory, but we have a feeling Carey needs to let herself grieve — at least for a little bit! END
BEGIN HERE As for why Carey and her billionaire fiancé split up? Rumors have it that he was particularly unpleased with a relationship his fiancé had with one of her backup dancers. He also (reportedly) wasn't a huge fan of the reality TV show to begin with, so there's that. According to NY Daily News, "The pair broke up at the end of the summer after a blowout fight while yachting in Greece" and that "Packer is reportedly barely present in the reality series and reports have circulated that he requested to be edited out of all footage." Ouch!  END
BEGIN HERE  Mariah Carey Is Demanding $50 Million From Her Ex-Fiancé James Packer END
BEGIN HERE But Mariah isn't agreeing with those rumors. On "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" last week, the singer said her ex-fiancé's request to be cut out of footage is simply an allegation and by no means the truth. She also opened up about how she's doing while dealing with her split saying, "I think I'm doing well...everything happens for a reason. Things are the way they are." END
BEGIN HERE Whether you’re newly engaged or coming to the end of your wedding planning, the holiday season can add a lot more to your to-do list. There’s shopping for gifts, holiday parties, hosting family and friends, and travel — which doesn’t leave much time for planning a wedding! Can you press pause for a little while and focus on just enjoying the season? Here’s what our experts have to say. END
BEGIN HERE Absolutely! If you’re getting overwhelmed with so much on your list (or just want to enjoy a few weeks as a newly engaged couple before you dive into the details), by all means, put planning on hold until things have calmed down. There are, however, a few things you’ll want to address first. END
BEGIN HERE If you’ve just gotten engaged, and want to have a shorter engagement, you may want to settle on a date so you know how much time you’re working with. You may also want to at least send inquiries to venues and planners (and possibly sign a contract) before you take a break, so the big details are covered. Then give yourself some time to enjoy the moment! END
BEGIN HERE If you’re deep into wedding planning, look at the timelines and to-do lists you’ve created. Is there anything that needs to be addressed soon, such as a payment to a vendor or a decision on dishes and flatware? Get a few things done in advance so there isn’t as much to address when you come back from your break. Be sure to let your wedding vendors know you’re taking a little breather, too, so they’re not frustrated when they don’t hear from you. They can also let you know if there’s anything else that needs to be taken care of ASAP.  END
BEGIN HERE Finally, if you’re going to take a break from planning, stick to it! Make a pact with your S.O. to keep wedding talk to a minimum, no matter how many questions your families ask. Write down any questions or ideas that come to mind, but do your best to set that list aside and tackle it once the holidays are over, when you can get back to the details and decisions with a fresh perspective and lots of holiday joy.  END
BEGIN HERE  4 Things to Keep in Mind If You're Planning a Holiday Wedding END
BEGIN HERE One of the most common wedding day worries amongst brides and grooms? A traffic jam as big as the day itself. Just imagine bumper-to-bumper traffic keeping you from saying "I do," or being stuck in the limo while your guests are partying it up at your reception. Pure nightmare fuel. But that wedding nightmare was actually reality for one Ohio couple when some unexpected traffic jammed up their big day. But they didn't let a pile-up rain on their wedding day parade. In fact, these newlyweds made the most of the situation by sharing their first dance right there in the middle of the highway! Now, this is how you handle a potential big day disaster... END
BEGIN HERE After Jeff and Rebecca Payne said "I do" at their Centerville, Ohio wedding ceremony, they hopped into their getaway car to head to their reception. The wedding cake, their friends and family, and their first dance all awaited them. But a major traffic jam on the US-35 was standing in these newlyweds' way. A multi-car accident had occurred that had totally shut down movement along the highway for two hours. According to People, thankfully no serious injuries were reported, but the maddening traffic was keeping this bride and groom from their own wedding reception. Like we said, total nightmare... END
BEGIN HERE But instead of just sitting and stewing for the two-hour holdup, the Paynes decided to claim the US-35 as their impromptu reception venue. The pair got out of their car and shared their first dance amongst the stalled cars and road signs. Motorists whose eyes were understandably caught by a bride twirling in the middle of the highway in her wedding dress got out of their cars to photograph the moment, and the hashtag #RescueThePaynes even began trending on social media. END
BEGIN HERE No word yet if the Paynes ever made it to their actual wedding reception, but at least they have one hell of a story to tell come their anniversary! END

BEGIN HERE Kimberley Zatlyn was working in London when her sister suggested she meet David Geffon, a longtime friend, for a drink. Their romance blossomed quickly, and Dave popped the question in front of the ocean on a trip to Maui. “It all made more sense after why he wore a rain jacket on a hot, but windy day in Hawaii — he needed to hide the ring somewhere!” Kim says. END
BEGIN HERE The couple had an elegant black-tie affair with an Old World feel in mind for their October 17, 2015, wedding. After visiting a few venues in California's wine country, the grand entrance and breathtaking gardens of Madrona Manor in Healdsburg sealed the deal. The venue’s director of events, Arielle Larson, served as the couple’s day-of coordinator and helped bring their classic vision to life. Read on to see the stunning details, captured by photographer Christina McNeill. END
BEGIN HERE Living less than two hours away from their Healdsburg venue made planning a breeze for this couple. Kim gathered inspiration and ideas from her two older sisters, and the decisive bride and groom chose not to look back once they made selections for their day. In fact, making big decisions about the wedding — like which venue to book and which photographers, baker, and florist they wanted — came easily for Kim and Dave, but that didn't mean they didn't face any challenges. "Planning a big honeymoon to Thailand and Tokyo and leaving the day after our wedding weekend was a lot to accomplish!" says the bride. END
BEGIN HERE The couple’s invitations were simple and elegant, perfectly in keeping with the feel they wanted for their wedding day. “We carried many of the elements weaved into the invitations right through to the actual day,” Kim says, including their white, black, gold, and peach color scheme. END
BEGIN HERE As soon as Kim tried on this strapless Vera Wang silk mikado wedding dress, she knew it was the one. “The dress suited me perfectly,” she says of the mermaid silhouette, which was fitted through the hips and fanned out with a full train. The intricate jeweled detailing on either side of Kim's waist and her silver peep-toe pumps from Jimmy Choo added just the right hint of glamour.  END
BEGIN HERE Her bouquet was a composition of white and peach flowers including garden roses, dahlias, and anemones, all tied up with a white ribbon.  END
BEGIN HERE Dave wore a Burberry tuxedo with a velvet bow tie by Yves Saint Laurent and black patent leather shoes. “It was such a dashing combination!” his bride says. The groom's boutonniere featured crisp white roses that were accented with touches of foliage. END
BEGIN HERE While Kim and Dave decided not to have bridesmaids or groomsmen, they did have three very important people in their wedding party: Their niece and nephews! Vera, the couple's adorable niece, served as their flower girl and wore a peach-hued dress that was hand-dyed to match the couple’s wedding invitations. Their nephews, Charlie and Jonas, were ring bearers. The two boys walked down the aisle hand-in-hand and carried a pillow topped with a doily made by the bride's grandmother. END
BEGIN HERE A guitarist performed during the ceremony, starting with “Here Comes the Sun” by the Beatles for the flower girl's and ring bearers' entrance. The bride and her father made their walk down the aisle as the music switched to "Spring" from the Four Seasons by Vivaldi. Dave’s brother, Jason, officiated a ceremony that was designed to be entirely personal to the couple. “Each word truly meant something to us and reflected our journey individually and as a couple,” Kim says. END
BEGIN HERE The bride and groom both felt strongly about including their friends and family in the ceremony, so one of Kim’s closest friends recited a poem by Victor Hugo, Dave’s aunt gave a touching speech, and his cousin sang “Blue Skies” by Irving Berlin. To honor loved ones that had passed away, the bride's cousin lit a single candle that was displayed alongside a cluster of wheat to represent Kim’s childhood home in the wheat fields of Saskatchewan, Canada. END
BEGIN HERE Kim admits that DIY projects aren’t her strong suit, but with the help of her mom, sisters, and niece, she was able to create a stunning seating chart for the reception. The women wrapped a canvas with a patterned linen paper in shades of gold, cream, and white, and pinned handwritten names and seat numbers to it. The final touch was a cluster of gold leaves found at the San Francisco Flower Market.  END
BEGIN HERE At the reception, guests were seated on the venue’s garden deck where they could take in the beautiful views of the property. Tables were topped with classic white linens and glass vases filled with peach and white flowers, including dahlias, roses, and ranunculus. A sprig of fresh rosemary was tucked into the napkin left at each place setting. END
BEGIN HERE Cocktail hour included light bites like roasted bell pepper and caper crostini and blue cheese shuffle with apple butter, but those tasty options only warmed guests up for the three course meal ahead. The first course was a plate of beets and garden tomatoes, and then friends and family chose between salmon, dry-aged beef, or mushroom risotto for their main course. END
BEGIN HERE For dessert, Kim’s mother baked a few of her infamous desserts, like homemade butterscotch confetti squares, marshmallow squares, caramel squares, and Nanaimo bars, a Canadian specialty. The newlyweds also had a choice of different candies on hand, including white Jordan almonds, peach candies, and gold M&M’s — one treat for each color used in the wedding décor. END
BEGIN HERE If that wasn’t enough to satisfy a stubborn sweet tooth, the couple also cut into a two tier white chiffon cake with bavarian custard. The confection had a lace-inspired buttercream frosting and was topped with fresh flowers and pearl details.  END
BEGIN HERE Kim’s words of wisdom for brides-to-be: “Focus your energy on the areas that truly mean a lot to you as a couple. The planning is part of the journey, seeing it all come together on your wedding day is an incredible feeling.” END

BEGIN HERE Every year, I receive literally hundreds of internship applications from young women who want to become wedding planners. We have a very strict vetting process for choosing the best candidates for the position, because we learned early on that an awful lot of people have a very wrong impression of what being a wedding or event planner actually is. END
BEGIN HERE Jennifer Lopez's portrayal in The Wedding Planner not only made it look like a wedding planner doesn't really do a whole lot (and can carry all her backup supplies in a fanny-pack on the big day), but she also broke a very basic rule that shouldn't even have to be stated — she flirted with, and eventually stole away, the groom. Can you even imagine the review that bride would have given her on WeddingWire?! END
BEGIN HERE My favorite movie wedding planner was Candice Bergen in Bride Wars. Imagine if a wedding planner could really tell her clients when they may get married! And if I ever tried to ask my brides to split my attention on their wedding day at the same venue, I imagine I'd be fired — if not worse. Brides want to be more than just "Bride One" and "Bride Two" on their wedding days. END
BEGIN HERE But seriously, wedding and event planning is a very detail-oriented — and sometimes emotionally intense — career choice. There are no industry-standard business hours. There are no holidays. We rarely have a free weekend. And we work when clients hire us to work (sorry, Candice — we don't tell them when to get married). END

Angela Yeung) nuptials were down right extreme? Well, you better take a seat because these over-the-top "I dos" just might make you swoon. The daughter of a famous Russian oil tycoon just tied the knot and, between the 900 wedding guests and the need-to-see-to-believe $600,000 wedding dress, this might just be one of the most lavish weddings we've ever seen... END
BEGIN HERE With an oil fortune that totes her last name, it was probably to be expected that the recent wedding of Madina Shokirova would border on the excessive. But this definitely takes the (wedding) cake... According to the Daily Mail, the nuptials took place at the luxurious Radisson Royal Congress Park hotel in Moscow, but the expensive wedding fun started even before the big day when the bride and her best gal pals (see photo below) headed to a resort in Spain for her bachelorette party — in a private jet, of course... END
BEGIN HERE Come the big day, Shokirova donned a wedding dress that has us sweating just looking at it. (Seriously, how much does that thing even weigh?!) The fabulous frock was designed for her by British fashion house Ralph & Russo and reportedly cost a whopping $600,000. Yes, really. What could've run up that bill so high, you ask? Well, blame the gown's elaborate embroidery, three-dimensional organza petals, and hundreds upon hundreds of dainty pearls and glitzy Swarovski crystals. NBD. Super casual, right? END
BEGIN HERE  How Much Would These 5 Famous Movie Weddings Cost? END
BEGIN HERE Also, we have a serious question: What on earth does one feed 900 (incredibly well-dressed) wedding guests? Answer: A 10-foot tall wedding cake, naturally. Shokirova and her sweetheart served up a big day dessert taller than a professional basketball player and required a fleet of strong servers to carry the thing. And if that wasn't enough to impress their guests, they also dropped an estimated $477,000 on entertainment for the night. END

BEGIN HERE Have you ever been to a wedding on Thanksgiving weekend? Opinions are mixed as to whether having your wedding on the second biggest holiday weekend of the year is a good idea. END
BEGIN HERE Traditionally, Thanksgiving and Christmas are times reserved for family. And once you get married, your family grows. With that growth, your obligations expand. Many couples rotate whose family they spend the special holidays with each year. If they suddenly receive a wedding invitation a few months ahead of Thanksgiving, it can throw the balance of everything into a tailspin. END
BEGIN HERE 1. Airfares are outrageous for Thanksgiving week. Easily as bad, if not worse, than Christmas and Spring Break. If a lot of your guests will have to travel to your wedding, you have to take that into consideration. Everybody knows Thanksgiving is one of the most heavily-travelled days of the year. END
BEGIN HERE 2. Some guests you'd really like to have at your wedding will not be able to join you. They'll already be committed with family, and unwilling to break their traditions. If it's somebody coming from out-of-town, you're virtually handing them an excuse to skip the expense of your wedding. Some must-attend invitees may think you're being a bit selfish by taking away their Thanksgiving weekend. It's a football lover's nightmare. END
BEGIN HERE 3. Wedding vendors have families too, so don't look for big discounts even if you're getting married someplace that is supposed to be in "off-season." I've had to resort to out-and-out bribery to staff large weddings on Thanksgiving. Professionals will hide their personal displeasure, and provide the very best vendor services for your big day. But you'll pay to have them servicing your wedding while their entire family is sitting at home enjoying turkey together. END

BEGIN HERE Can you imagine just a few decades ago it was the norm for brides and grooms to leave their wedding reception early and head straight for their honeymoon?

Check out what these real brides believe was the best time to head on their post-wedding adventures. END
BEGIN HERE "My husband and I went to Italy. We got married on a Friday and flew out Sunday evening. I liked going the same weekend of our wedding so we could be in "celebration mode" and there's something so special and traditional about going right after your wedding. Leaving on Sunday gave us just enough time to settle down from the whirlwind of getting married, spending a day having ear to ear smiles with my new husband, finish up laundry and pack before leaving for 2 weeks. Our flight was an overnight one, so we were super tired and jet lagged the first day but because we were both so excited to be in Italy for the first time we plowed through!" —Pam, Sept. 2015 Wedding END
BEGIN HERE "We got married in South Carolina which was a destination wedding for us from NJ, so we decided to do our honeymoon travels a few months later, in November. We also bought a house the December before our wedding, so we wanted to spread out the milestones. It was the best decision ever. We still had something to look forward to and a special time ahead. It also helped with the post- bridal blues, which I definitely had. We went to Tulum for a week and it was incredible" —Christine, May 2015 Wedding END

Right now the front-runners are South Africa and Bali!" —Meredith, Fall 2018 Wedding END
BEGIN HERE "We left the Monday after our Saturday wedding. We wouldn't change a thing. After all the planning and stress of a wedding, a tropical vacation is just what we needed.

BEGIN HERE To start, instead of looking outward at what everyone else is doing, try to look inward and reflect upon what brings you joy.

The possibilities in nature are endless," she says. END
BEGIN HERE When it comes to planning for the big day, looking and feeling beautiful is at the front of every bride's mind. However, it can also create a lot of stress to look absolutely perfect on the special day. We'll try almost anything, spending thousands of dollars on products, the newest treatments, laser, surgery, and so forth, all in the name beauty. And trust me, I am a natural-beauty junkie and love to experiement with the latest and greatest. But the most important tool I have added to my beauty ritual is meditation. END
BEGIN HERE Stress is the number one beauty killer. When we're stressed out, it shows. If you put your most stressed out friend next to another friend who is care-free and happy, you notice the difference immediately. From dark circles, puffy face and eyes, dull skin, frown lines, acne, to even weight gain, stress shows up on our faces and bodies in so many difference ways. If we don't handle the stress, it doesn't matter what we use on our skin. END
BEGIN HERE Science has proven many, many benefits to meditation, such as higher levels of happiness, better sleep, lower blood pressure, and improved immune systems. The reason meditation is your greatest beauty tool is because it's your ticket to destressing, every single day, as many times a day as you want. Beauty, real beauty, is when you're able to shine from the inside out. But if you're not really feeling good about yourself — physically and/or emotionally — then that light gets quite dim. Meditation help us choose better thoughts about ourselves. All day long we engage in thoughts like "I'm not perfect, I'm not pretty enough, I'm not skinny enough, I'm not good enough," all of which put even more stress on our minds and bodies. When we add meditation into our lives, we can begin to put the more negative thoughts to rest and choose positive thoughts. More positivity brings less stress, more happiness, and in turn, infintely more radiance. Here is a simple meditation you can add into your daily routine and is the perfect meditation to take with you all the way to the big day: END

BEGIN HERE Word on the street is that Prince Harry is dating American actress Meghan Markle. But before things get serious and we start planning the next royal wedding, there's one crucial thing that needs to be discussed. Could Prince Harry ever marry Meghan Markle since she's been divorced? END
BEGIN HERE Besides the fact that we already know she looks killer in a wedding dress, there may be some hoops to jump through to make it happen. The short answer: Probably, yes. The long answer, however, involves some very interesting protocol for royal marriages — which includes an archaic rule by George III's Royal Marriages Act of 1772 prohibiting senior members of the royal families to wed a Catholic (along with commoners or divorcees). The 35-year-old American actress, best known for her role in Suits checks off two of those forbidden boxes (being that she was married before and went to Catholic school), according to People. Luckily for our favorite ginger and his new leading lady, that ban was softened last year, and the new rule is that only the first six royals in line have to ask the Queen for permission to marry (as well as senior members of the royal fam are now allowed to marry a Catholic). So we may have a royal wedding on our hands sooner rather than later — whew. END
BEGIN HERE And while we wait for our favorite eligible British bachelor to get more serious with his new gal (hey, he did say he's ready to start a family!), here's a bit of a back story on the royal marriage situation. Apparently, the law came into effect in 2015 after Prince George was born, when there was talk that if the children were raised Catholic, they wouldn't be able to inherit the throne (and if Georgie had been a girl, a second-born son would have had precedence over a first-born girl in the same family, according to People). The law was established due to the monarch being the Head of the Church of England, which is of Protestant Anglican faith. END
BEGIN HERE Even if the law were still an issue, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles would have some explaining to do if Prince Harry and Markle were the were forbidden to marry. In 2005, Queen Elizabeth gave Charles permission to marry fellow divorcee Camilla Parker Bowles (with some reservation, as she and Prince Philip didn't attend the ceremony — burn). END
BEGIN HERE Thank goodness for papa Prince Charles, since the law now seems to be a non-issue, with the heir to the throne noting that he will be a 'defender of faiths' rather than just Anglican Protestantism — meaning that heirs to the throne can practice whichever religion they prefer. END

BEGIN HERE As your wedding day gets closer, it's time for the bachelor and bachelorette parties to begin. Whether you're having your celebrations the same weekend or are celebrating at separate times, it's a great idea to surprise your man with a token of your love and excitement for your soon-to-be wedding. Check out these ideas on how you can surprise him (without being a meddling or anxious bride) and his crew on their special weekend. END
BEGIN HERE   Consult the best man for ideas or details on some (not all!) aspects of the itinerary to help you plan a small surprise. If they're going somewhere for dinner, you can take care of a round of drinks, shots, or desserts by calling ahead and adding to the reservation. Headed to a game? Pack a team t-shirt or hoodie in his bag as a small token. If they're going to a casino, maybe you want to stuff some extra cash in his wallet for good luck. With the help of the best man or groomsmen, your surprise can be truly unique and custom! END
BEGIN HERE Adding an eye-catching wedding ceremony backdrop behind the spot where you and your groom will say "I do" will help draw all of your guests' eyes front and center. After all, the exchange of vows is the most meaningful part of the wedding ceremony, so it is important to put some thought into making the altar the main focal point of the ceremony space. And whether you're tying the knot indoors or outside, a beautiful ceremony backdrop will impress guests as they arrive and take their seats, and will also make for some seriously gorgeous photographs (and Instagrams!). END
BEGIN HERE Couples these days are becoming more and more creative with their ceremony backdrops, decorating the space with everything from flower-adorned arches and wooden arbors to hand-painted murals and suspended Edison light-bulb installations. But one of our favorite ceremony-backdrop ideas? Combining glamorous, sparkly chandeliers with soft, ethereal panels of draped chiffon. The glowing chandeliers lend an elegant, more traditional feel to the ceremony space while the airy, sheer-chiffon panels create a warm, romantic ambiance. The combination of the two is utterly unexpected, elegant, and chic. Here are six of our favorite takes on this stunning ceremony-backdrop trend. END
BEGIN HERE  Extra-long chiffon panels help soften up the rough-hewn look of this weathered, rustic barn; also, the hanging chandelier helps creates a focal point for the ceremony and vow exchange. END

BEGIN HERE Taylor also gave her fans another peek into her big day earlier this week, posting another wedding day photo that showed the newlyweds beaming after tying the knot, with Taylor holding a red rose bridal bouquet. With both the bride and groom rocking jeans and biker jackets, this is officially the coolest couple ever! END
BEGIN HERE When it comes to choosing your wedding party, you've got so many people to choose from: Childhood buddies, college BFFs, siblings, your closest friends in your new city... the list goes on! It's already a lot of options, but there are even more when you reconsider the age requirement. So how old is old enough to be a bridesmaid, and which of your gals is too young for the job? Our experts weigh in. END
BEGIN HERE While the cut off between a flower girl and a junior bridesmaid is clearly set at "tween," figuring out where to draw the line between junior bridesmaids and bridesmaids is a little more tough. You'll want her to be old enough that she can hang out with your friends and still feel comfortable, but also don't want to deny the spot to a special woman in your life just because she doesn't have a driver's license. END
BEGIN HERE There are two logical places to draw the line between your junior bridesmaids and your bridesmaids. The first is to place the cut-off at 17 or 18 — i.e. making a high school diploma a requirement. This will ensure that the 'maid in question is a little more grown up, which will make her more comfortable amongst your 20-something friends and make her feel like she's part of the gang instead of just your little sister or younger cousin. END
BEGIN HERE The second option is to draw the line at 21. This will enable her to attend your bachelorette festivities, whether you're heading to a winery or hitting the Vegas Strip. It would be a bummer to leave your sister behind, especially if she has Maid of Honor status, and setting the bar a little higher means she'll be able to participate. END
BEGIN HERE Of course, you can also define the role however you'd like to accommodate the girls you love. If your sis is 15, why not let her still serve as your MOH? There's no reason that special role can't go to someone a little younger. Include her in as much as possible, then send her down the aisle with a groomsman when the time comes! END

BEGIN HERE You're never fully dressed without a smile — or the proper accessories. When it comes to your wedding day accessories, that couldn't be more true. There are a few items that no bride should be without, including longwear lipstick, breath freshener, tissues and a cell phone. So it stands to reason that you'll need a functional — and more importantly stylish — way to carry them. For many blushing brides, a classic clutch is the accessory of choice. It's a chic way to stash your essentials, plus, it doesn't take up too much space. Here, we've rounded up our fave clutches to complement your bridal style. END

BEGIN HERE When Michael Bruns proposed to Victoria McCauley, there were fireworks — both of the metaphorical and literal sense. He asked Victoria to be his wife during a July 4th celebration, during their two families were present and could join in on the fun. (In fact, the soon-to-be father of the bride filmed the proposal while posing incognito on a neighbor's porch!) "This had to be the most surprising moment of my life," Victoria says. END
BEGIN HERE The couple would later gather their family (plus 200 additional guests) for a September 19, 2015, destination wedding in Charleston, South Carolina, where they often traveled to visit Victoria's brother. He also served as the couple's eyes and ears on the ground of Charleston. In fact, the couple trusted his recommendation of Lowndes Grove so much that they committed to the venue before seeing it in person. Spoiler alert: They weren't disappointed. "Lowndes Grove is the epitome of a Southern home," Victoria says. "I had always dreamed of a beautiful outdoor wedding." With the help of A Charleston Bride, that's exactly what the couple got. Their outdoor fete was gorgeous down to every last Southern detail (just wait until you see the couple's cigar bar). Photographer Virgil Bunao was on hand to capture their late summer celebration, all seen below. END
BEGIN HERE Victoria didn't choose her Kenneth Pool wedding dress for its dramatic, sheer back or hand embroidered-lace details, although those certainly didn't hurt. "I loved this gown because it was comfortable," she says. "This was important to me because I knew both Mike and I loved to have a good time." Plus, with a simple bottom half, the lace on her cathedral-length veil really stood out. END
BEGIN HERE Her white and blush bouquet contained garden roses, hydrangeas, and gilded hypericum berries for a dash of glamour. END
BEGIN HERE Michael went with the most classic wedding look: A black and white tuxedo, complete with a bow tie and pocket square. He also wore a watch Victoria's parents had given him for Christmas. END
BEGIN HERE Victoria's bridesmaids wore a mix of different champagne-hued gowns for the big day. "I wanted them to have options so they could choose what they felt more comfortable in," she explains. Like the bride, each 'maid carried a round bouquet of ivory and pink flowers, but Victoria's arrangement had something special: Her florist tied her grandmother's hanky, which had once been stitched on her bonnet for her baptism, around the handle of her bouquet. "At my bridal shower, my mom gave it to me and the bonnet had been undone to wrap around my flowers for my wedding day," she says. END
BEGIN HERE Mike asked his groomsmen to mimic his traditional attire in black and white tuxedos, and he gifted the men their black bow ties. END
BEGIN HERE The ceremony was held at Trinity United Methodist church. There, their florist decorated pew ends with clusters of white hydrangeas to make the aisle pop and two large floral arrangements that flanked the altar.  END
BEGIN HERE Victoria and Michael considered writing their own vows, but ultimately decided on a traditional ceremony. "I guess I had always pictured I would say what I had heard in the movies on my wedding day," the bride says. "There is something special about repeating the same vows that our parents, grandparents, and other generations before have said." END
BEGIN HERE At the reception, the couple set up a suspended cigar bar with vintage Pepsi crates hanging from a tree branch. For guests that preferred to pass on cigars, the bride and groom also arranged a lounge sitting area, complete with a sofa, chairs, and a chandelier. Cocktail tables covered in blush-colored linens gave friends and family another place to relax between trips to the outdoor bar that served up delicious drinks. END
BEGIN HERE The couple's reception tent draped in gold chiffon, and guests found their seats at tables covered in blush-colored linens and centerpieces that included towering trumpet arrangements to small gilded boxes filled with roses, hydrangea, and stock. Five crystal chandeliers hung above the tables, lending a romantic glow to the space. END
BEGIN HERE Everyone noshed on a Southern-inspired menu that included cornbread, shrimp and grits, fried green tomatoes, crab cakes, and beef filet, plus au gratin potatoes made from the mother of the bride's own recipe. END
BEGIN HERE Victoria and Michael's cake might have been the reception's most interesting décor element: The tiered confection was suspended from the ceiling with crystal cables and nestled in a bed of hydrangea, roses, and stock. It included layers of vanilla cake with raspberry jam and salted caramel buttercream and red velvet cake with cream cheese buttercream. END
BEGIN HERE The party then moved to a separate tent for dancing, where the bride and groom kicked things off with "Can't Take My Eyes Off You" by Frankie Valli. "I have always been a huge fan of oldies, considering that's all my mom let me listen to in the car growing up," Victoria says. END
BEGIN HERE After the party wound down, the newlyweds departed on their honeymoon to France. It was the first time Michael had ever been to Europe. "We left two days after our wedding and arrived in Paris," says Victoria, adding they also visited Cannes, Nice, and Monaco. END

BEGIN HERE Ryan Reynolds is once again proving that he and Blake Lively are Hollywood's biggest power couple even when he majorly screws something up. A couple of weeks ago the Deadpool star had a big ol' slip-up when he accidentally revealed the sex of baby number two to all of his Twitter followers. At least he's not the only one... We're looking at you, Ashton Kutcher! In the not-so-subtle tweet, Reynold's joked, "The mobile above my daughter's crib is just a whole bunch of NuvaRings. So she remembers how lucky she is." Being the super private couple that they are (come on, they have like three Instagram photos together), we could only imagine the sht storm of trouble he was in at home for revealing that baby James wasn't the only little girl in the household anymore. END
BEGIN HERE When we thought the actor couldn't get in any MORE trouble as is, he confirmed our suspicions that baby number two is in fact a girl while talking to Conan O'Brien on his late-night talk show. We guess the cat's out of the bag!? "Two [kids] under two is tough," Reynolds explained to Conan. "Yeah, a lot of estrogen. It's like an American Girl doll took a sht on my life." Ruh-roh. END
BEGIN HERE It seems that Lively was not very happy about this recent slip-up, at least according to her oh-so revealing Instagram post featuring a chocolate cookie and a glass of milk. She captioned the drool-worthy pic saying, "The ways I know that @vancityreynolds got himself into huge trouble on @teamcoco tonight: Not only did he come home with my true love, @levain_bakery cookies, but he personally toasted them for me and brought me a cup of milk WITH ICE. Literal brownie points." END

BEGIN HERE When there's choreographed wedding dance in the mix, it's usually the bride or groom's idea. But at Utah bride Mikayla Phillips' wedding, her dad, Nathan Ellison, was the one to bring up the idea of a choreographed father-daughter dance to do on his daughter's wedding day. And they ABSOLUTELY killed it. END
BEGIN HERE Thanks to his persistence, the bride, 25, and her dad, perfectly executed a choreographed mashup during the father-daughter dance that lasted almost four minutes — and was totally epic. The routine started with a slower regular dance to "Butterfly Kisses," which was quickly followed by a mirage of songs, according to ABC News. In the video, Phillips and Ellison whip out sunglasses and dance to over 10 hits including M.C. Hammer's "U Can't Touch This," Tom Jones' "It's Not Unusual," Dawin's "Dessert," and NSYNC's "Bye Bye Bye," all over the course of four minutes. END
BEGIN HERE Phillips, who is a trained dancer, said it was actually her dad's dream to choreograph the dance and perform it in front of everyone — and since she is the only girl, it was his only chance to do something like this. "He for years has talked about doing that and he finally convinced me," she said. END
BEGIN HERE The father-daughter duo looked very well practiced, but turns out that they only started choreographing the week leading up to the wedding. "Every night [in the week] prior to the wedding, we'd run through it a few times," Phillips explained. "I think since we'd talked about it for years that it was pretty easy for it to come together." END
BEGIN HERE The dance was captured on camera by Bethany Petersen, the couple's wedding videographer, and the video already has over 200,000 views on YouTube since being posted. "It was the highlight of the reception," the bride said. "The most fun thing was seeing my dad and how happy he was. That was a dream fulfilled," she told GMA. But, the (obviously) best part of the day, in her eyes, was marrying her husband. "The actual best part of that day was marrying my best friend," she said. END
BEGIN HERE Sound the alarms because J.Crew is killing its reasonably affordable bridal line which, after 12 years in the business, has dressed many a bride and bridesmaids. END

BEGIN HERE Apparently the bridal sector simply wasn't economically viable for the company, at least according to Racked. "The brand's collection of bridal gowns, bridesmaids dresses (even jumpsuits and crop tops) were always front and center in its catalogues, and even anchored an Upper East Side store," the website wrote. "But over time, J.Crew's bridal business became more of a burden than a boon, according to a source close to the brand. The category proved to be inefficient, financially speaking." END
BEGIN HERE Even though this news has hit us pretty hard, there is a silver lining to all of our disappointment. The prices on both wedding and bridesmaid dresses have been cut by 30 to 70 percent on their website! You better hurry though — once the inventory is sold out, they're done. Run like the wind! And by run like the wind we obvs mean check out these deals and online shop 'til you drop. END

BEGIN HERE The future Mr. and Mrs. spent just over a year planning their May 2, 2015, wedding at Guastavino's. They worked with Fête to design an elegant, youthful wedding beneath the venue's vaulted ceilings and settled on a soft, springtime vibe with seasonal cherry blossoms filling every inch of the space. From the garden-inspired chuppah to mirrored dining tables, every detail was curated to fit perfectly with their theme. Planning a spring wedding of your own? Right this way for some totally gorgeous inspiration, photographed by Nathan Smith for Ira Lippke Studios. END
BEGIN HERE The white-on-white beading of Rebecca's hand-embroidered Naeem Khan wedding dress is absolutely breathtaking. "I tried on over 50 dresses from different designers. I liked so many of them, but this one made me feel the most like myself," she says. END
BEGIN HERE Beneath her gown, the bride wore shimmering Jimmy Choo sandals. She topped her soft waves with a classic veil. Rebecca's bouquet of all-white peonies was wrapped in beaded lace that matched the details on her dress. END
BEGIN HERE "There was so much anticipation leading up to our first look," says Rebecca of the moment she first saw Doug on the stairs of the St. Regis Hotel. "When we finally got to see each other all dressed up, we were put at ease and all the nerves went away." END
BEGIN HERE Doug wore a navy blue tuxedo with a black lapel from John Varvatos, which he paired with an Irish linen pocket square. END
BEGIN HERE The wedding party continued the couple's classic theme, with the women in long black dresses and the men in black tuxedos. "Everyone feels great in a black dress, especially if they can pick their own style," says Rebecca. END
BEGIN HERE Instead of a traditional shuttle bus, the couple went with a more fun option to get from the St. Regis to Guastavino's: A trolley! END
BEGIN HERE At Guastavino's, guests were greeted with yarmulkes and ceremony programs displayed on antique silver trays. END
BEGIN HERE Rebecca walked down the aisle with both of her parents, then met Doug beneath a chuppah of vines, white roses, peonies, and hydrangeas on a garden trellis. "We wrote our own vows, which were heartfelt, a little silly, and perfectly reflected our relationship and how we feel about one another," says the bride. END
BEGIN HERE Now this is an escort card idea you may not have seen before. In the middle of the bar at cocktail hour, an oversized sign displayed guests' names and table assignments, so they could figure out where they were sitting as they grabbed a drink! They were then directed to long tables, topped with mirrored runners and lush arrangements of cherry blossoms. END
BEGIN HERE Between the cherry blossoms, low arrangements combined garden roses, peonies, ranunculus, and anemones. The lighting was kept warm and natural, with lots of candle light accentuating the centerpieces. END
BEGIN HERE Bud vases full of hyacinth and bowls of blackberries added a hint of purple to the blush and white centerpieces. For dinner, guests dined on Atlantic halibut and filet mignon. "I'm a huge dessert person, so in addition to wedding cake, we served peach cobbler and passed snacks on the dance floor, like Momofuku Cake Truffles, Fat Witch brownie bites, and Venerio's mini cannolis!" says Rebecca. END
BEGIN HERE Doug and Rebecca's first dance, to "How Sweet It Is" by James Taylor, was completely choreographed. "We spent many hours at Arthur Murray Dance Studio!" END
BEGIN HERE The four-tiered carrot wedding cake, decorated with Swiss dots, was topped with a 3D-printed sketch of the bride and groom in their wedding-day finery, created by a friend of the couple. END
BEGIN HERE Knowing her heels would end up hurting her feet, Rebecca ordered a custom-made pair of Converse, with a platform heel, to change into during the reception. END
BEGIN HERE "Doug and I ended up thrown in the air by his friends a few times throughout the night. It was so fun! I felt like I was at a crazy concert in a wedding dress," Rebecca says. "Remember, your wedding doesn't have to be like everyone else's. Make it unique to you — you'll have a lot more fun planning if it feels authentic!" END

BEGIN HERE "We are so excited for Jinger and Jeremy," family patriarch Jim Bob said in a video recently posted to the family's website, announcing the news of the nupitals. "They just got married and they are such a sweet couple. Jinger is one of the most dynamic, beautiful, Godly girls that I know, and Jeremy is such a passionate, loving, kind spiritual leader. They're a dynamic duo... A match made in heaven." We'll say! END
BEGIN HERE According to People magazine, Duggar and Vuolo said their "I dos" at the Cathedral of the Ozarks at John Brown University, where the bride walked down the aisle in a classically beautiful wedding dress featuring three-quarter length lace sleeves and carried a lush bouquet full of white blooms and trailing greenery. END
BEGIN HERE So with eight sisters, who was the one to stand by Jinger's side as maid of honor? Jessa Duggar Seewald was the Duggar sis to score the privilege. Meanwhile, Vuolo's brother Charles was named best man, while the groom's father officiated the ceremony himself. END

And when it comes to your big day, a gorgeous glow is a must. It makes your teeth look whiter and can even create the illusion of being slimmer. END
BEGIN HERE But before you head to store and start scoping out products, there are a few things you need to know. First, not all self-tanners are created equal. Some can you leave looking, well, like an oompa loompa. Second, proper prep (aka exfoliation) and application is the key to success. Third—and this should go without saying, but we will anyway—the color of your complexion matters. If you have fair skin don't overdo it with the deepest shade on the market. END

Rumor has it that the 19 Kids and Counting alum and her fiancé Jeremy Vuolo's wedding is set for this weekend. Unlike her two older sisters, Jessa and Jill, this bride-to-be has reportedly been keeping the date of the big day a secret from the public, opting for small, more intimate "I dos." We wonder what Jim Bob has to say about this... END
BEGIN HERE The Duggars officially win the prize for most efficient wedding planning after pulling off a fully-planned big day in a mere three months. This family has definitely have had some practice, after all. By the time their 19th kid gets hitched, we're sure Jim Bob and Michelle will have wedding planning down to a two-week process! In late July, 22-year-old Jinger announced that she was engaged to Vuolo, a former professional soccer player, after a short courtship — a.k.a. the famed Duggar-family approved form of dating that consists of no sex, no kissing, chaperoned dates, and side-hugs only. Guess Duggar and Vuolo were in a bit of a rush to get started on their presumed 19 kids, as word on the street is that they're about to say "I do!" Here's what we know... END

"Our Family will be in Arkansas for an event that we are not at liberty to share with you at this time," writes the Rodrigues. "We will share more of those details with you later.

BEGIN HERE It's hard to resist the temptation to take pictures at your friend's wedding. She's going to look stunning, the décor will be on point, and everyone will be smiling and having a blast. You'll want to capture those moments! But there's nothing worse than a beautiful shot of the bride and groom's first kiss, with a friend or family member leaning out into the aisle with their phone to get a picture of their own. So should you put your camera away when it's time for your friend to walk down the aisle? Our experts weigh in. END
BEGIN HERE Before you take out your camera, figure out if your friend would be okay with you snapping a few shots. Was there a note on her website specifying that the ceremony will be unplugged? Did you pass a sign on your way to your seat, or see a disclaimer at the top of the ceremony program? Did the officiant make an announcement about putting your phone away before the processional started? If you were asked to keep your phone and camera in your purse during the ceremony, listen! You'll be helping make sure your friend has the ceremony she wants, as well as get the pictures she's hoping for. There's an added bonus: Keeping your phone in your pocket means you'll be 100% present as the ceremony proceeds, won't miss a single detail of the sweet vows, and will be able to truly share in their joy. END
BEGIN HERE If you weren't told not to take pictures, consider doing so anyway. Sure, you won't be able to Instagram that moment your friend comes down the aisle, but you'll be able to see it instead of watching through a screen. And with all the money your friends spent on their photographer, they'll appreciate that you did your part to make sure their pictures look as great as possible. So maybe encourage the guest seated next to you to do the same! END

Nobody. It's time to think smarter, not harder brides-to-be! We rounded up four of our favorite tips to help with meal prep while wedding planning. END
BEGIN HERE   Having the right meal prep tools and storage containers is key for seamless cooking, storing and of course — eating! Microwavable, dishwasher safe and BPA free are all key words that are important to look out for when selecting which products to buy for food storage. The easier they are to heat and clean, the better. Many meal-prepping mavens prefer bento style lunch boxes with lids, with separate compartments to store veggies, lean proteins, and starches. They also help keep portions in check. The right (fashionable yet practical, of course) lunch tote, insulated thermoses, reusable cooling packs and water bottles are essential, too. END

Not to mention — guests who are history buffs will love such an original, historical wedding venue. Brides who want to experience this special affair can find out how in the step-by-step process below. END
BEGIN HERE Wedding dress ? Check. Elegant updo? Tested and approved. Makeup? Your mood board says it all. But what about your nails? Although your wedding day manicure will likely take a backseat when deciding your beauty looks, it's definitely one that should not be overlooked. Think about all of the things that you'll be doing with your fingers on your wedding day — throwing your bouquet, holding your partner's hands, wearing your new wedding band — the list goes on. Your nails need to look as good as ever, but don't sweat it if you haven't given your polish too much thought yet. BRIDES spoke with Essie celebrity nail artist, Michelle Saunders, to find out what you should consider when deciding on a wedding nail look. Here's what she had to say. END
BEGIN HERE   Should anything disastrous happen to your manicure on the day of your wedding, it would be wise to arm yourself with a handy emergency kit. In it, keep a nail file, a cuticle clipper, hand cream, and of course, the nail polish of your wedding manicure. Essie's new Gel Couture line is a great option for brides because you can reapply the polish without having to use a UV lamp in the event you have a mani emergency. END
BEGIN HERE No matter where your approach to pre-wedding diet and exercise places you on the spectrum between bridezilla and bridechilla, it's safe to say every bride-to-be has her own set of problem areas that make getting in shape for the Big Day not exactly stress-free. And while there are plenty of healthy, accessible ways to achieve your best look, sometimes a girl needs a little extra help... END
BEGIN HERE So when we heard acclaimed New York City dermatologist Dr. Dendy Engelman was debuting a next-generation technology in skin tightening and toning, we jumped at the chance to test it out. The noninvasive body-shaping treatment uses the BTL Vanquish ME, a device that emits radio frequencies to send targeted heat under the skin's surface and kill fat cells deep within. END
BEGIN HERE "In comparison to other treatments on the market, BTL Vanquish ME works on both soft, pinchable fat and harder, firmer fat because the machine has a large spot-treatment area to 'melt' it away," Dr. Engleman explains. "Once the fat cells are destroyed and eliminated from the body, they're gone forever, meaning the results are permanent." END
BEGIN HERE Sound too good to be true? Well, I decided to put Vanquish to the test, and here's how it went down: Over a period of six 30 to 45 minute treatments I basically sat around and let the machine do its work. That's right, all you have to do is sit there while the fan-like device is placed over top of the targeted body part, be it your stomach and love handles, upper back, or thighs. (The machine doesn't actually touch the skin, as it can get quite hot, but rather hovers a few inches above it.) The experience is actually quite soothing, and since you can't use a cell phone during treatment — as cellular radio frequencies can interfere with the machine — it's actually a perfect way to decompress and meditate to rid yourself of any pre-wedding stress. END
BEGIN HERE After the third time, I started noticing that my lower abdomen had slimmed out a bit, especially when we combined each treatment with 15 minutes using another gadget called the BTL Cellutone. This device looks like an oversize pen with a flat metal disk on the end that a technician moves across the treated area to provide an oscillating massage therapy (fancy term for "it basically slaps you like a rubber band a hundred times"). The goal is to increase blood supply for better lymphatic drainage, improved elimination of fat cells, and overall smoother results, which definitely took effect a few months after completing my sixth treatment. END
BEGIN HERE  Semi-Permanent Bridal Beauty Treatments to Try Before the Big Day END
BEGIN HERE Like all noninvasive therapies, the Vanquish isn't a fool-proof miracle worker, but, as Dr. Engelman explains, you'll achieve maximum efficacy when you maintain a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and drink a ton of water during the two days before and after each treatment. "This isn't a ticket to binge! But it gives you that extra boost to get rid of that stubborn fat," she says. END
BEGIN HERE So while "get perfect bod" shouldn't be on your wedding to-do list, it's good to know well-heeled docs like Dr. Engelman can come to the rescue in a pinch. She recommends planning out four to six treatments at least six months before the wedding, but if you find yourself sweating it out every day to no avail, "It's possible to fit in as many as four treatments one to two months before the Big Day, as long as your schedule allows for last-minute appointments!" she says.

BEGIN HERE After the party is the after party, whether it's a dance party at your favorite club or a few reserved tables at the local bar. If you're planning to keep your wedding festivities going all night, some more celebratory drinks will be in order. Do the hosts have to pay for them, or can you ask guests to pay for their late-night drinks themselves? Here's what our experts have to say. END
BEGIN HERE Just as with your wedding reception, there's no hard-and-fast rule requiring that you pay for everyone's drinks through the after party. If you are inviting your guests to an official continuation of your wedding reception, here are a few different ways to address the drinks situation: END
BEGIN HERE If you want to offer a partial open bar, you could choose a few options (say, your favorite beer and your favorite mixed drink), then let guests know that anything other than those beverages won't be covered. So if they're craving a gin and tonic instead of your signature Moscow Mule, they're on their own. END
BEGIN HERE You could also set a cash limit on your tab, covering all of guests drinks up to a certain dollar amount, then switching over to a cash bar. This might only be enough to cover the first round, but after an evening of hosting, no one will blame you! END
BEGIN HERE Don't want to spring for booze? If you're also going to serve late-night snacks at your after party, you could offer hosted food (and maybe add on non-alcoholic drinks like soda) and have all alcohol be served at a cash bar. END
BEGIN HERE And of course, it could just be a trip to the bar in your wedding finery, with nothing paid for by the two of you except your own drinks — if anyone will let you buy yourself a glass of wine while you're wearing a wedding dress, that is! END
BEGIN HERE  Do We Have to Go to Our Own After-Party? END
BEGIN HERE Your guests will think they've stepped into a winter wedding wonderland (say that three times fast) with this Aspen-inspired wedding color palette. Create a cozy chalet-esque ambiance by layering knits and sheepskins in shades of cream around lounge areas during your cocktail hour and reception, draping them over chair-backs and couch arms. Picking a venue that has a ski-lodge vibe is also key, so look for one with lots of light-colored wood and maybe even a stone fireplace or two (especially if it's actually wintertime!). END
BEGIN HERE Make sure you keep your palette ultra-monochrome (think cool grays, whites, creams, tans) to keep true to that wintery feeling, and to help add interest mix in subtle patterns and pops of copper. Choose a wedding dress full of subtle and textural details, perhaps 3D flowers layered with a delicate lace in the coldest shade of white, and throw on a super thin metallic belt to round out your look. Get fun with your accessories and have your 'maids wear heels with a touch of fur like this Aquazzura pair, or try a hat in a sophisticated neutral like this one from Eugenia Kim. END
BEGIN HERE Instead of the expected lush white centerpieces of a winter wedding, add to the modern vibe with tall arrangements of blossoming branches, like dogwood or cherry blossoms (hint: ask your florist or event planner if they can rent any faux-branches if these are out of season, there are tons of good-looking fakes out there!). In lieu of a traditional bouquet, buy a bundle of these magnificent 3D printed flowers in all white (we think the poppies are perfect, but the Etsy vendor has lots of options!), and you'll have a beautiful and unique reminder of your wedding forever! END
BEGIN HERE Forget classic white, this marbled cake with copper edges will fit perfectly in your wedding color palette, and same goes for this gorgeous invite from Bliss and Bone — modern and refined — perfect for your Aspen-inspired soiree. At the reception, mix in lots of tapered gray and white candles in varying heights and shades with your branchy arrangements, and have your place cards propped on hexagonal matte holders that fit in perfectly to your monochrome tablescape. Try a signature cocktail of white hot chocolate and peppermint liquor in calligraphed mugs — the mugs will double as favors and your guests will love a cocktail that keeps them warm! END
BEGIN HERE There's officially a new Mrs. on The Hills block! Audrina Patridge has married her sweetheart Corey Bohan in an intimate destination wedding in Hawaii this weekend. And no, homeboy did not wear combat boots to the beach... END
BEGIN HERE Since saying goodbye to her on-screen boyfriend Justin Bobby all those years ago, Patridge has indeed upgraded from her combat boot -wearing beau. Bohan, a professional BMX athlete, proposed to Patridge a year ago over an ultra-romantic dinner. "When dessert time came he ordered cheesecake and the waiter brought it out on a platter with a beautiful silver cover," the former reality star later shared with People. "I noticed all the waitresses gathering with phones and thought, 'What is going on?!' Then, all of a sudden, the waiter lifted the silver cover and I saw the ring in a box with white rose petals on the plate." Much better than a slice of cake, no? END
BEGIN HERE And the happy surprises kept coming for Patridge, when she announced that she was pregnant just a month later. This summer, Patridge and Bohan welcomed their little girl, Kirra Max Bohan, into the world. Think she played the part of an itsy bitsy flower girl at her parents' nupitals? Looks like we'll soon find out! END
BEGIN HERE Patridge and Bohan tied the knot on Saturday, November 5, according to E! News. The couple said their "I dos" in front of an estimated 100 wedding guests and the Hawaiian sunshine in an outdoor ceremony, but let's get to that wedding dress shall we? On the big day, Patridge wore a form-fitting bridal gown that hugged her slim figure. But the simple silhouette was made all the more elaborate with its intricate embroidery — so stunning! The former MTV star also wore her long brown locks down for the occasion, making the overall look all the more soft and romantic. END
BEGIN HERE  Lauren Conrad Shares Never-Before-Seen Wedding Photo to Celebrate Anniversary END
BEGIN HERE No word yet on guest list specifics, but we already know of a few lovely ladies who didn't manage to score an invite... "No one from The Hills made the cut," Patridge previously revealed. "If we were doing a really big wedding, I'd invite them, but we're keeping it intimate." END
BEGIN HERE Dating may have never been more complicated than it has been this year as Hillary Clinton battles Donald Trump in the race for the presidency. The presidential election alone causes stress that can spill over into your relationship. But standing on the opposite side of the polls from your partner is a whole 'nother (very bad) story. END
BEGIN HERE "This particular election season has become so volatile," says relationship and etiquette expert April Masini. "The conversations have changed." END
BEGIN HERE As a recent survey by Zola shows, rooting for opposite political parties can take its toll on your partnership. The registry site surveyed more than 800 couples, then crunched the numbers to see whether, in this climate, these guys and gals could stomach their partners' votes for the opposition. Spoiler alert: Most of them can't. In fact, supporting the opposite party in this race could flat-out ruin your relationship. END
BEGIN HERE Zola found that a whopping 93 percent of Democrats would not marry someone who was voting for Donald Trump. (It's probably a good thing, then, that 87 percent of those left-wingers are engaged or married to someone of the same political party.) END
BEGIN HERE Republicans, on the other hand, are a little more forgiving of their partner's crossing party lines. A full 59 percent of them said they would marry someone who plans to vote for Hillary Clinton. But, even so, 84 percent of the Republicans surveyed are engaged or married to another Republican. END
BEGIN HERE And lastly, Independents are perhaps the most understanding political party, with 77 percent saying they'd happily marry a Hillary Clinton supporter and 44 percent being amenable to exchanging "I dos" with someone who'd vote for Donald Trump. Interestingly, only 29 percent of the Independents surveyed are engaged or married to another Independent party member. END
BEGIN HERE Of course, if you find yourself crazy about a man or woman who's voting for a candidate you couldn't support yourself, that doesn't mean your relationship has to end or that you can never tie the knot, as these survey respondents may say. END
BEGIN HERE  The Wives and Weddings of Donald Trump END
BEGIN HERE "Ask yourself if this is a hill you want to die on," suggests Masini. "What this cliché means is that there are so many deal breakers and sticky situations in relationships on a good day — so is this really what you want to fight about at the expense of the relationship?" Maybe it is, and maybe it isn't. It's something you need to think about, either way, if you find yourself voting for opposite candidates. END
BEGIN HERE "There are lots of places in any relationship where there is disagreement," Masini points out. "Do you really want to break up a relationship because of who you're voting for? I know that for some the answer is yes, but just make sure you're clear on your own answer. If the answer is no, then back off. Find your sense of humor, your ability to dodge aggressors, and an interest in other topics." END
BEGIN HERE Newsflash, brides-to-be: Being engaged isn't an excuse to stop dating! In fact, date nights are all the more important when you're under the stress of wedding planning — and celebrity couples are no exception! Rumored fiancés Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth just stepped out for a rare (and totes adorable) public date night over the weekend, hitting up a super artsy gallery with outfits to match. And like any good date night, they of course took a cute couple-y selfie to show off on the 'Gram! END
BEGIN HERE After almost an entire year of are they or aren't they back and forth, we've finally got the engagement confirmation of our dreams when Miley Cyrus finally referred to the bling on her left ring finger as what it is — an engagement ring — during her appearance last month on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. "This isn't really my aesthetic but I'll wear it because you love me," Cyrus said she tells Hemsworth of her bridal bauble. Okay, so she may not be a fan of her own bling (crazy, right?!), but THANKFULLY the pop star is still toting that Neil Lane sparkler around town — including on her weekend date night with her fiancé. END
BEGIN HERE Although the pair typically try to keep a low-key public profile, they headed out hand-in-hand for the grand opening of a friend's photography exhibition on Saturday November 5, according to Entertainment Tonight. Hemsworth and Cyrus were spotted at Los Angeles' Museum at Retail Space Gallery, wearing ensembles equally as eye-catching as their photographer pal's snapshots that covered the walls of the event space. END
BEGIN HERE  Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth Did Their Own Carpool Karaoke and It's Amazing END
BEGIN HERE Dressed in a smiley-face yellow mod-inspired frock, Cyrus was all a-glow with her hubby-to-be by her side — and her engagement ring on her finger! Meanwhile, Hemsworth was just as colorful as his sweetheart, wearing a boldly printed jacket. The couple that dresses crazy, stays together, amiright? END
BEGIN HERE San Francisco has always been a culinary melting pot. Italian and Chinese immigrants, fisherman, bakers, and chefs have left delicious legacies that tell the story of the city though iconic dishes.

BEGIN HERE They stunned us last winter with unbelievably GORG wedding photos, and now Witney Carson and Carson McAllister have done it again — with a (fur) baby! The Dancing with the Stars pro shared on Instagram that she and her hubs have just added a puppy to their family. END
BEGIN HERE "We have a baby and she's perfect," Carson wrote under her precious Instagram snap of McAllister and their sleepy new fur baby. The dancer and her high school sweetheart-turned-husband shared photos of their new little fluffball sleeping on her back in McAllister's arms. Carson, 23, shared another photo shortly after of the pup awake and alert, captioning it, "sorry for the puppy overload, but I mean can you blame me?!" combined with emoji overload of hearts and heart eyes. We really can't — she's adorable! END
BEGIN HERE The DWTS pro married her beau in Salt Lake City on New Year's Day wedding that is what winter wedding dreams are made of — with pictures to match. The bride wore a traditional white Rivini wedding dress for the ceremony complete with a lush, organic bouquet. END
BEGIN HERE The guest list of the Salt Lake City wedding was full of Dancing with the Stars alum and professional partners, with Lindsay Arnold, Emma Slater, Jenna Johnson, and Brittany Cherry all serving as bridesmaids (in matching pale pink Amsale bridesmaid dresses, of course!). Previous contestants Carlos and Alexis Penavega and Alfonso Ribeiro were also in attendance for the three-part wedding that included an intimate religious ceremony, a romantic dinner, and reception planned by celebrity wedding planner Michael Russo. END
BEGIN HERE The couple pulled off their wedding in record time, announcing their engagement only three months before the big day. "She was my dream girl since 7th grade," the groom told People of his beautiful bride. "From the second I got to know her, I could tell she was the most loving and understanding girl I'd ever met." The pair met in their hometown of American Fork, Utah, and have been together for five years. END
BEGIN HERE Now that they've expanded their family and added a new little furry BFF into it, we can only hope that they're going to make it a family of four sooner rather than later. First comes love, then comes marriage...you know how the rest of it goes! See below for the adorbs photos of their new little lady (and a throwback to their nuptials). END
BEGIN HERE She may not have won that final rose, but Bachelor alum AshLee Frazier snapped up something even better this weekend — an engagement ring! (In our opinion, diamonds trump about-to-wilt blooms every time!) So who's the lucky guy to finally land Frazier's heart? Read on for all the proposal deets... END
BEGIN HERE We first met the reality star in 2013 when she compete for Sean Lowe's love on season 17 of The Bachelor. Frazier ultimately came in third on the reality show, losing Lowe to winner Catherine Giudici. Lowe and Giudici have since wed and expanded their little family to three with the addition of their baby boy, Samuel Thomas. And while we're totes happy for the pair, fan-favorite Frazier was still looking for love. After her Bachelor stint, the lifestyle blogger headed to the islands to try and find a hubby on season one of Bachelor in Paradise the following year. But alas, Frazier left the sand and sunshine without an engagement ring on her finger. But it looks like the ABC alum's luck has finally turned around! END
BEGIN HERE TMZ just spilled the news that Frazier finally got her bridal bling. And it comes courtesy of the reality star's current sweetheart, Aaron Williams, a real estate developer from Frazier's hometown of Houston. According to the gossip mag, when Frazier returned to Texas earlier this year, she and Williams — a friend she's reportedly known for years — took their relationship to the next level. And now the girl has quite the ring to show for it! END
BEGIN HERE So how did the question get popped? Frazier and Williams took a trip to New York City last week and Williams snagged the opportunity to propose at one of the town's most famous landmarks — the Brooklyn Bridge! According to TMZ, the groom-to-be dropped down to one knee right there on the bridge, amongst the Saturday throngs of tourists. And rumor has it, Frazier is now rocking a three-carat oval-cut engagement ring. Swoon... END
BEGIN HERE  Every The Bachelor and The Bachelorette Proposal That DEFINITELY Made You Ugly Cry END
BEGIN HERE It used to be that the biggest concern a bride had about her mother's wedding outfit was that the mother of the bride didn't wear anything close to white. In my opinion, nobody is supposed to wear white, except the bride. But it's doubly inappropriate when it looks like the mother of the bride is trying to steal attention away from her own daughter. END
BEGIN HERE I don't think Emily Post could have even conceived of some of the atrocious mother-of-the-bride outfits I've had the pleasure of seeing in almost 10 years of wedding planning, or she would have dictated some stricter rules. END
BEGIN HERE It isn't the really ugly dresses that stand out in my mind — those were entertaining, but not all that memorable. The ones I cannot get out of my head stood out for entirely different reasons. Reasons that would made any logical mother realize that she absolutely, positively should not have worn that outfit in public, much less to her daughter's wedding. Here, the top 3 wedding day looks mothers of the bride should steer clear from. END
BEGIN HERE   It's your daughter's big day, and you want to look good. But you shouldn't choose a dress that stands out in a big way from the way all the other guests. For example, if your daughter's having an afternoon wedding on the beach, and cocktails and dinner in a tent, it's not the time to choose a full-length beaded gown. It's also not the time to bust out a brightly-sequined cocktail dress of questionable length. END

BEGIN HERE Cinderella isn't the only person who has fallen in love with a handsome stranger on the dance floor at midnight. In February of 2012, Amalie Keerl was flying solo at The Boston Winter Ball, an annual fundraiser full of 20-something professionals. "As the clock struck 12, I forced myself onto the dance floor, jacket in hand and looking completely unapproachable," she remembers. And there was Richard Masucci. "He told me I looked pretty, and asked me to dance. The rest is history!" A year-and-a-half later, in the privacy of their kitchen, Rick asked Amalie to marry him, and the pair quickly began planning an extravagant black tie wedding, a nod to the night they met and a celebration of their future. END
BEGIN HERE Amalie and Rick planned a formal affair for 210 guests at the Boston Harbor Hotel on December 31, 2015. Their vision? Gatsby glam with plenty of black, white, champagne, and gold details. "It was a New Year's wedding, but we wanted to keep it more subtle. Less noise makers and resolutions, more glitter and romance!" says Amalie. The bride took the reigns on the elegant design, from the formalwear the couple wore in their engagement photos to the gold foil cards in the invitation suite to what the bride calls "a tasteful amount of glitter in the air." We can't think of a better way to ring in the New Year — and to kick off the next chapter in Amalie and Rick's lives! Take a peek at their chic, elegant bash — with some sparkle, of course! — photographed by Carly Michelle Photography. END
BEGIN HERE The classic invitation suite included gold calligraphy, formal letterpress details, and a sketch of the Boston Harbor Hotel's iconic rotunda. END
BEGIN HERE Every New Year's bride needs a fabulous pair of festive shoes! Amalie chose Christian Louboutin sling-backs, accented with gold glitter heels and laser cut lace appliqués on the toes. END
BEGIN HERE Pre-wedding gifts are always a sweet surprise, and Rick raised the bar when he presented Amalie with a Cartier love bracelet in the brand's iconic red leather jewelry box. END
BEGIN HERE The petite bride slipped into a gorgeous form-fitting Rivini wedding dress, with lace appliqué on the bodice and straps. She topped it off with a fur collar to fend off the winter chill — though she barely needed it on the unseasonably warm December day! END
BEGIN HERE "I knew we were having a winter wedding, and while I loved a lot of the dresses I tried, none of them were screaming 'classic winter wedding' to me," Amalie remembers. "This dress was the perfect combination of classy, Gatsby-era chic and a winter feel." Rick's Hugo Boss tuxedo was just the thing to complement his bride's gown. END
BEGIN HERE We're loving Amalie's all-white bouquet, which combined roses, ranunculus, and anemones with olive branches and seeded eucalyptus. END
BEGIN HERE Even the tiniest members of the wedding party, the couple's two ring bearers, donned formalwear for their trip down the aisle. "They looked so grown up!" Amalie gushes. END
BEGIN HERE Instead of choosing a single gown for her 'maids to wear, Amalie's bridesmaids were instructed to choose their own floor-length dresses in gold and champagne hues. "They all looked gorgeous, and I think it's because they all felt beautiful and comfortable in what they'd chosen. They were literally glowing!" the bride says. The ladies carried smaller bouquets of white roses to match Amalie's, and the groomsmen matched Rick in classic tuxes. END
BEGIN HERE The ceremony was officiated by one of Rick's childhood best friends, former NHL player Rick DiPietro. The simple altar was a wooden table covered with a lush display of white blooms and glowing votive candles. END
BEGIN HERE Simple ceremony programs echoed the classic style of the pair's invitation suite. END
BEGIN HERE When it was Amalie's turn to walk down the aisle with her parents, she surprised Rick by having a soloist (with a striking resemblance to John Legend!) perform "All of Me." "It's our favorite song, and I knew Rick would love it," says the bride. END
BEGIN HERE After the ceremony, Amalie took a moment to freshen up her lipgloss — and to swap her stilettos for a pair of all-white Nikes so she could dance all night! END
BEGIN HERE In honor of their New Year's Eve wedding date, the pair purchased over 200 champagne corks and used them as escort card holders. Amalie also collected antique gold desk clocks and set them all to go off just before midnight. "It was the perfect way to ring in the new year!" she says. END
BEGIN HERE A formal wedding overlooking Boston Harbor wouldn't be complete without an indulgent menu! Guests dined on Maine lobster and sweet shrimp risotto, then chose between filet mignon with caramelized onions and spinach-stuffed chicken breast. END
BEGIN HERE In the ballroom, which boasts waterfront views, champagne-hued linens were topped with mirrored displays that featured vases of single varieties of blooms, like roses, hydrangeas, and ranunculus, and floating candles in tall candle holders. END
BEGIN HERE When not sipping celebratory champagne, guests chose between The Blushing Bride (a mix of sparkling rosé and pomegranate seeds) and The Dirty Sooch-ini (a vodka martini with a blue cheese olive). END
BEGIN HERE The dessert spread included a wedding cake wrapped in gold ribbon, decorated with white ranunculus and olive leaves, and chocolate-covered strawberries and other miniature desserts alongside a hot chocolate bar with all the fixings. END
BEGIN HERE The "2016" marquee numbers, which graced the table that also served as the altar during the ceremony, were hand-made by the bride. END
BEGIN HERE "We danced the night away overlooking the glimmering lights of the city," Amalie remembers. "There was a beautiful energy in the room." And after the countdown was over and 2016 arrived, the couple ended the night as every winter ball should: With fireworks over Boston Harbor! END
BEGIN HERE "The best choice we made was to greet our guests during cocktail hour," says Amalie, who honeymooned with Rick in St. Lucia. "That way we could enjoy the rest of the reception without worrying about anyone else!" END

BEGIN HERE Fall brides know the struggle all too well how does one plan a wedding around football season?! If your nuptials coincide with one of the boys' big games, chances are you're going to hear grumbles about it from your guests. Sadly, one 27-year-old groom from St. Louis was able to avoid this situation altogether, but only because his longtime love broke things off before their November 5th wedding. END
BEGIN HERE Sean Bradshaw, obviously bummed about you know not marrying his sweetheart of three years, decided he wasn't going to sit inside all day sulking about his would-be wedding day. Nope, this football fan did the only thing he knew how in a situation as rough as this: he turned to his family. Instead of spending the day alone on the sidelines so to speak, Bradshaw, his dad, and his little brother bought tickets to the Notre Dame versus Navy football game in Jacksonville, Florida. END
BEGIN HERE Still feeling the sting of heartbreak, the ex-groom created a pretty hilar sign he carried around for the game that read, "Today's supposed to be my wedding day, she made me choose: her or Notre Dame," to which he put a check mark in the Fighting Irish box. Hey, nothing gets between a man and his pigskin! "I've always been a fan and I always will be," Bradshaw told Good Morning America. "Leaving the game, I got stopped by a lot of people giving their well wishes." END
BEGIN HERE Unfortunately, his favorite team lost to Navy 28-27, but that didn't defeat his hopes for the future. At the end of the day, this groom reminds us what is really important in life. It's not your team winning the big game, but rather the family and friends you experience the game with. He told GMA how thankful he was for having such a thoughtful family. "I wouldn't expect any different," he said. "That's what family is there for anyways. It means a lot to me." END

Because if there's one thing we're thankful for this Monday morning, it's all of lovely wedding photos from real couples. So here's our weekly round up of our favorite photos from real couples who just got married this weekend. Want to share your wedding photos with us from your own big day? Tag @brides and  END
BEGIN HERE Exactly (well, almost...) one year after getting engaged, Dancing with the Stars pro Mark Ballas and his fiancé BC Jean tied the knot in a beautiful fall wedding the day after Thanksgiving in Malibu, California. Our favorite part of the bride's wedding look? Her unique and sparkly head piece that matches her gorgeous beaded wedding dress. Now if only we could see a glimpse of that first dance... we know it would have scored a 10!     END
BEGIN HERE Well, this is certainly something we've never seen! And something we're pretty sure only wedding planner extraordinaire, Mindy Weiss could pull off. This beautiful bride is on her way via paddleboat to meet her groom at their destination wedding in Tahiti. Talk about #WeddingGoals, amirite?       END
BEGIN HERE That feeling when you see your bride for the first time? Unforgettable! Right outside the Waldorf Astoria, all the groomsmen were right there to capture the moment. They will definitely cherish this one forever.    END
BEGIN HERE Victoria and Jake said their "I do's" this weekend at Windsong Ranch in Texas. Photographed during magic hour, this couple is glowing with happiness.     END
BEGIN HERE This is one way to get the party started! During their first dance at The Breakers in Palm Beach, this bride literally got swept off her feet. Good thing her groom is sporting a pair of kicks because it looks like it was the start to a long night of dancing! END
BEGIN HERE After you’ve said your “I dos,” danced as husband and wife for the first time, cut into your wedding cake, and popped the champagne, keep the wedding celebration rolling with a day-after brunch. For a brunching experience that’s just as memorable as the wedding itself, we’ve put together a list of five LA restaurants with delicious brunch menus and private dining spaces where you and your closest friends and family can relive all the memories of the night before while sipping mimosas and digging into stacks of French toast.  END
BEGIN HERE This teen mom is all grown up and we can't get enough of her big day! On October 8th, Teen Mom star Maci Bookout said "I do" to her fiancé Taylor McKinney in a stunning destination wedding in Greenville, Florida. We've already did our fair share of obsessing over the gorgeous wedding photos that Bookout's photographer, Brittany Cole of Brittany Photographs, shared with BRIDES, but now we're flipping over the footage of the newly-aired nuptials. November 28th's finale of Teen Mom OG featured Bookout and McKinney's wedding, and in case you missed it, we have a sneak peek that's definitely worth a watch... or two... or three... END
BEGIN HERE In case you forgot from when we shared photos of the MTV star's big day (but really, who could forget?), the newlyweds married at Florida's Honey Lake Resort in a beautiful rustic wedding, so stunning it deserved its own reality show! (But last night's feature was a pretty good compromise, we guess!) Bookout walked down the aisle of the property's charming chapel in a unique and über-romantic Riki Dalal Haute Couture wedding dress in a soft mauve hue, holding a rich bouquet of burgundy and peach peonies — a look that went straight on our inspiration Pinterest boards. And thankfully, MTV's sneak peek gave that fab frock plenty of airtime!  END
BEGIN HERE The clip features the moments leading up to the beautiful Bookout walking down the aisle. Guests — including Bookout's Teen Mom co-stars Catelynn Lowell and Tyler Baltierra — excitedly fill the chapel's seats. The bridal party (wearing gorgeous custom Watters' gowns in a brand new French Blue hue, we might add!) and the groomsmen drive up on golf carts and line-up to begin the procession. And in probably the sweetest scene you'll catch all day, Bookout's oldest child, 8-year-old Bentley, leads his two younger siblings down the aisle, all three little ones dressed to the totes adorable nines.  END
BEGIN HERE This is almost as good as actually scoring an invite! (Almost...) END
BEGIN HERE  Every Engagement Ring Style, and the Celebrities Who Wear Them END
BEGIN HERE It's safe to say that the breakout wedding star of the year — in more ways that one — is Hamilton. Groomsmen all over the country are taking the stage at weddings and performing their renditions of the hit Broadway musical-rap, and to prove that point, we've found a new wedding toast to the tune of "My Shot" to take the (wedding) cake.   END
BEGIN HERE The best man began the epic serenade pretty modestly, telling the bride and groom, “I’ve written a little poem for you two.” As he began his "poem," he all of a sudden stopped in his tracks and said, “You know what? If I’m going to do anything about Hamilton, I’m going to sing it.” The crowd obviously went wild.  END
BEGIN HERE "First and most important, love each other whole-hearted," he crooned to the tune of "My Shot," one of the musical's most note-worthy tunes, while offering up both advice and a good ol' fashioned wedding roast to boot. "Open up and trust each other, don't let yourselves be too guarded. A policy of honesty is what Matt will want to see, but Matt will call her out every time that she's farted!" Touché there buddy — we're sure the bride was thrilled at that revelation. END
BEGIN HERE The groomsman continued with his performance, mimicking the lyrics of the musical's refrain, saying, "I know it's sounds sappy but they're young and in love and happy, and they're not throwing away their shot." The audience began to clap and sang along, clearly loving it. END
BEGIN HERE "Third on my list is to safely commit to one another my brother and I have to admit, the vow you made tonight to the love of your life, who, by the way looks out of sight." He went on to share the story of how they met and even what the bride absolutely loves. "Bring her back a cheese and Haagen Daasz and put on some Real Housewives," he rapped. Now that's the way to a woman's heart. END
BEGIN HERE As he got further and further through the song, the wedding singer and the audience joined along. "They're not throwing away their shot," they repeated, and even the bride and groom stood and clapped along. At the end, the couple of honor hugged him as the crowd cheered. It's safe to say (but probably doesn't even need to be said) that Lin Manuel Miranda would be proud. END
BEGIN HERE Because, baby, it’s cold outside, and as bride and groom, it’s your duty to turn up the heat! Keep wedding guests comfy cozy at you winter wedding no matter your venue (outside or indoors) with everything from hot soups to homemade hand warmers and even a shot of tequila (that’ll warm ‘em up real quick!).  END
BEGIN HERE    Krystel Tien, owner & founder of Elle Bridal Boutique & Couture Events in San Diego, loves warming up a wedding with scented candles. “Choosing a signature winter scent for the wedding like vanilla, cinnamon, apple pie or peppermint can create a cozy feel from the moment guests walk in the door,” she says. END
BEGIN HERE It may be football season, but one could argue that a marriage is really the ultimate team sport. After all, as marriage coach and psychotherapist Toni Coleman explains, in a marriage, two teammates have one another's backs, every contribution counts, and a win for one is a win for all. But what does it take to put in that team effort? Read on. END
BEGIN HERE    According to Doares, "If you've ever watched the level of play of a team that is on a winning streak, you will see how every member is upping their game. They don't want to be the one who makes the mistake that breaks the streak." You can mimic their motivation in your marriage. "If you stay focused on what you agreed to do and follow through on it you'll turn your marriage into a lasting dynasty," Doares says. END
BEGIN HERE Rarely is life as sweet as the first hours, days, and weeks of being engaged. Our advice?  Prolong that lovely period for as long as humanly possible. END
BEGIN HERE How to prolong it?  Easy:  do not — we repeat — do not get into the nitty-gritty of wedding planning right away. Why?  Because as soon as you start making real, actual plans, you’ll face the pressures of sticker shock and other people’s opinions.  We want to help you postpone these complicating realities, since you’ll be living in them for many months to come. Here are three fun things you must do before you start wedding planning. END
BEGIN HERE    Immediately (and just for fun) get to trying dresses on. You can’t possibly buy a gown this early in the planning process, as you don’t have a clue what your budget is, much less the style of your wedding. Book an appointment at a major bridal chain just to have the experience. Tell the salesperson, “This is my first pass; I’m not ready to buy today,”  and go crazy trying on every style you want — especially those you’d never envision yourself wearing.  END
BEGIN HERE Remember: you have months and months of real-world wedding planning ahead of you. Your goal now: stay in the newness, fun, and simple joy of just being engaged and postpone the nitty gritty details for as long as possible. Cheers! END
BEGIN HERE Allison Moir-Smith is a bridal counselor specializing in engagement anxiety and cold feet. END
BEGIN HERE Keeping on top of wedding gifts and thank you notes can feel like a second job if you’re not organized from the beginning. But even the most organized of brides runs into this little snafu at least once: A gift without a note. How can you write a thank you note if you don’t know who the gift came from? Our experts have a few tips for figuring out who to thank. END
BEGIN HERE The first thing to figure out is if the gift was purchased off of your wedding registry. If so, log in and see if the registry’s thank you tracker has a record of who purchased the gift. Keep in mind, though, that some do offer the option of keeping the purchaser’s name a secret. In that case, try calling customer service — they might be able to let you know who bought the gift.  END
BEGIN HERE Not on your registry? If the gift was shipped directly from a store, call to see if an associate can pull up a record of what was purchased. With your name and shipping address, they may be able to solve the puzzle! It will also be easier if the gift was mailed with a receipt. END
BEGIN HERE If neither of these options pan out, do some sleuthing. Ask your mom or dad if they know of a friend or relative who sent you a gift, and see if what you’ve received sounds familiar. Did the type of gift give you a hint as to whom it may have come from? Don’t be afraid of making a phone call, letting them know you’ve received a gift without a card and want to make sure you can send a thank you note! And if you’re still not having any luck, wait until you’ve heard through the grapevine from a guest wondering if their gift made it to you, or until after your wedding, when you’ve received most of your gifts and have the list narrowed down.  END
BEGIN HERE  When to Send a Thank You Note for a Backordered Gift END
BEGIN HERE From champagne spills to torn trains, wedding dress disasters can — and do — happen. Not even celebrity brides are exempt! (Apparently you can't pay someone to slo-mo dive in front of a piece of falling food for you...) Just ask Audrina Patridge, who suffered a major wardrobe malfunction on her wedding day — and lived to tell the tale! END
BEGIN HERE When Patridge wed her now-hubby Corey Bohan in an intimate destination wedding in Hawaii earlier this month, the former Hills star's bridal glow nearly rivaled that of the island sun! There's no denying that Patridge looked drop dead gorgeous in her form-fitting wedding dress with its elaborate embroidery. But did you notice anything missing from her big day ensemble? Patridge ditched the traditional veil for her walk down the aisle, but not for the reason you might think. In fact, the bride's lack of headpiece was actually the result of a wedding wardrobe malfunction! Here's what went down... END
BEGIN HERE Patridge just came clean to E! News, explaining that she didn't go veil-less for her walk down the aisle for stylistic reasons, but because of a major mishap that occurred mid-procession. It turns out that the MTV star did complete her bridal look with a long luxe veil, but as she was heading towards the alter, the headpiece became snagged on something, stopping this bride in her tracks. "I was like 'Dad, it's grabbing!'" Patridge said, explaining the moment of horror when she was walking arm-in-arm with her pops. "It's coming off and my head is being pulled back!" Uh-oh! That situation would understandably send even the most unruffled bride into a freak-out frenzy. But Patridge handled the moment like a total pro! "So I said crap, and just took it off and kept smiling," Patridge explained. Way to keep your cool, girl! END
BEGIN HERE During her interview, this newlywed (who officially just won the award for the chillest bride, ever) also noted how quickly the day flew by. "All that work you put into planning and then it's over in a second," she said. File that under why you shouldn't let a little wedding wardrobe malfunction keep you down! END

BEGIN HERE When Michael Madalon proposed to Meghan Kelleher on August 30, 2014, he knew the day was going to be special, but didn’t realize quite how meaningful the date was. “Unbeknownst to Mike, he proposed exactly eight years to the day after we first met as juniors at Miami University!” says Meghan. “We met on the first day of Spanish class, and while neither of us can speak a lick of it today, we got more out of that class than either of us could have imagined.”  END
BEGIN HERE This “Miami Merger” (that’s what they call the 14% of Miami University alums who marry their classmates!) took place on September 12, 2015, with 148 guests gathering at the Apawamis Club in Rye, New York — halfway between Michael and Meghan’s parents’ homes. “We were drawn to the feeling of hosting our friends and family in a space that felt like home,” says the bride. With a timeless vision, rustic details, and relaxed accents that kept the black-tie affair totally down-to-earth, this duo made it official in stunning style. Take a look for yourself, photographed by Michelle Lange Photography! END
BEGIN HERE Meghan has a passion for paper, so she teamed up with Katie Roden of Linen & Leaf to design an invitation suite mixing modern calligraphy, light green letterpress, a custom wax seal, and vintage stamps that each held a special meaning to the bride and groom. Invites don’t get more personal than that! END
BEGIN HERE These Pura Lopez sandals, with colored feathers down the front, were Meghan’s first choice for her wedding day. However, she didn’t want to ruin them with a 90% chance of rain in the forecast, so she reached into her closet for blue patent Yves Saint Laurent sandals for a "something blue" that was already perfectly broken-in. END
BEGIN HERE But the sweetest accessory of all had to be Riley, the couple’s golden retriever. Although she couldn’t come to the wedding, Riley was dressed up in a floral garland and made the cutest cameo while Meghan was getting ready and at the church post-ceremony! END
BEGIN HERE As she shopped for her wedding dress, Meghan loved nearly every Romona Keveza gown she tried on. But the winner was this lace trumpet style, found on a mother-daughter shopping trip in Charleston. “I called my mom while she was waiting for her flight home, and we realized we’d both been going back to photos of this dress. That’s when I knew it was the one,” says the bride. Add a cathedral-length veil edged in matching lace, a side-swept chignon, and a loose and organic bouquet of peonies, astilbe, and seeded eucalyptus, and we’re swooning, too! END
BEGIN HERE Meghan’s favorite color is green, and the airy “Dusty Shale” hue of these chiffon J.Crew dresses was the exact shade she wanted her bridesmaids to wear. Each woman carried a bouquet in cream and blush, mixing garden roses, dahlias, and seeded eucalyptus.  END
BEGIN HERE Mike and his groomsmen all wore classic tuxedos. “He didn’t want any frills,” Meghan says of the sleek and simple look.  END
BEGIN HERE “The hardest part of planning the wedding was doing it all from a distance,” says Meghan, who lived in Charleston until just three months before the big day. “When I moved back to New York, Mike and I squeezed a great deal of planning in at the last minute!” END
BEGIN HERE The pair’s ceremony was held at St. Agnes Cathedral. “I was nervous about getting married in such a large church, but it’s where I was baptized and confirmed, and having the ceremony there meant I could get ready at my childhood home,” Meghan explains. “It made for a very nostalgic morning!”  END
BEGIN HERE To contrast the traditional church ceremony, Mike and Meghan planned a relaxed cocktail hour, beginning with an old-fashioned trolley used to transport guests. The Apawamis Club’s terrace was decorated with custom cornhole boards, crates full of Coca Cola in glass bottles, and a string quartet playing classic rock. The bar served up “The Riley” (gin, lemon, cucumber, mint, and aloe water), named after the couple’s dog, and “The Irvin” (vodka, vermouth, and blue cheese olives), named after the building where they first met. Cocktail napkins were printed with fun facts about the pair’s near-decade together.  END
BEGIN HERE Inside the club, escort cards were arranged on silver trays and set on a table decorated with votive candles and a lush arrangement of eucalyptus branches, hydrangeas, dahlias, and roses.  END
BEGIN HERE “The ballroom is quite formal, so we mixed in farm tables, wooden bars, and candlesticks from thrift shops to give it a more rustic vibe,” Meghan says. Taper candles added height to the tables, while the soft palette of white, blush, and green kept everything feeling light and airy.  END
BEGIN HERE “From the moment we got engaged, Mike and I spent a lot of time visiting local thrift shops to find urns, candlesticks, and other brass accessories to mix in to the centerpieces,” Meghan says. The vessels were filled with astilbe, dahlias, ranunculus, and roses. Place cards were hand-written modern calligraphy on torn paper, which was finished with the bride and groom’s wax seal. A sprig of eucalyptus was tucked into each light gray napkin.  END
BEGIN HERE The dinner menu was full of specialty items, from mini cheeseburgers with beer shooters during cocktail hour to the filet mignon and prosciutto-wrapped halibut meal choices. “I grew up eating Ralph’s Italian Ices, and really wanted to incorporate that into our menu. We had a lemon Italian ice palate cleanser before dinner, and passed blackberry ices on the dance floor!” Meghan says.  END
BEGIN HERE “Every aspect of our wedding reflected who we are as a couple. We wanted our guests to know they were at our wedding!” says the bride. The classic white wedding cake had layers of lemon cake with tri-berry compote and cream cheese filling. Favors were another one of the bride and groom’s favorites, Birthday Cake Truffles from Momofuku Milk Bar! END
BEGIN HERE After a night of dancing and an epic sparkler send-off, Mike and Meghan headed to Park City, Utah, for a few days before relaxing on the beaches of Hawaii. “It was the perfect mix of adventure and relaxation,” she says.  END
BEGIN HERE “When you’re planning your wedding, it’s easy to get caught up in what can go wrong,” says the bride. “But in reality, all that matters is marrying the person you want to spend your life with. Appreciate and enjoy every minute, because it will go by in a flash!”  END

BEGIN HERE One bride from Long Island was recently shocked by what she found in her inbox — a scathing email from a food truck vendor she had been looking into hiring for her wedding. The bride-to-be, Amanda De Pascale, was understandably upset after reading the nasty email, and decided to share the experience on her Facebook page. The New York-based events dessert company, called Sweetery, has since responded to the event by firing the employee who sent the horrible words to De Pascale and has apologized for the whole ordeal. But after you read this lengthy email, do you think you could possibly forgive them? We're not sure we could. END
BEGIN HERE The letter said: END
BEGIN HERE As for why the employee freaked out on the bride? According to a Fox News interview, De Pascale said, "My fiancé and I wanted something a little different for our wedding and we thought it would be so fun to have a food truck for our guests to get little sweets." So when she started her search, she found Sweetery online and decided to reach out for a quote. But when the dessert company got back to her and said it would cost $2,900 for her wedding day, the bride decided it was out of her price range and forgot about the email completely. Apparently though, Sweetery wasn't pleased with the lack of response. De Pascale said, "They kept calling me, multiple times an hour, then would stop for a few hours, then call back again. I told them, 'I can't talk right now,' and hung up. But he continued to call and call for about two weeks." END
BEGIN HERE Since receiving the hateful email, which included sentences like, "We truly hope your wedding bombs and turns out to be a complete and total disaster of the century" and "We are here to tell you that you are a weak meager spineless empty sack low life piece of trash," the bride-to-be told Fox News that it has left her "shaken and shell-shocked." TBH, we're not sure what's so sweet about Sweetery.  END
BEGIN HERE  This Groom's Secret Girlfriend Just Crashed His Wedding — In a Wedding Dress END
BEGIN HERE If your fantasy wedding includes hand-painted watercolor save-the-dates, a naked cake and a breezy bridal gown (think Mara Hoffman, Savannah Miller or Stone Fox Bride), chances are you're a boho bride. From a polished, bohemian bash in the Hamptons to a rustic, glam fete in Ohio (we're still having major flower envy) to a relaxed oasis in Vieques, boho weddings are as unique as the brides themselves — with a few discernible decor and vibe similarities, of course.   END
BEGIN HERE Looking for the perfect complement to your bridal 'do — whether it be vintage, modern or rustic? While flower crowns are a bohemian staple, they aren't the only whimsical adornments for your big day. This season, it's all about soft waves, loose updos and pretty plaits, embellished with ethereal bridal accessories. These fresh styles capture the romantic spirit of the most special day of your life. END
BEGIN HERE    Our roundup wouldn't be complete without a boho braid. This textured fishtail is stunning on its own. Intertwined gold vines add dimension as well as a lovely soft glow, creating a bespoke look that will definitely add some wow to your walk down the aisle. END
BEGIN HERE For many couples, a signature wedding cocktail is a really fun way to welcome guests to their weddings in celebratory style. When I got married on New Year’s Eve, my husband and I each had our own signature drink — I had a champagne cocktail and my husband had his signature whiskey drink. For our one year anniversary, I am planning on recreating both beverages, and using the barware we received as a wedding present to ring in the New Year.  END
BEGIN HERE For those of you just starting your wedding registry, I highly recommend investing in creating your own bar area, with a bar cart, a wine subscription, and definitely new barware.  END
BEGIN HERE Zola just launched Crafthouse by Fortessa, a new collection of modern barware, designed by World Champion Bartender Charles Joly. Charles recently won a James Beard Award, the highest honor is the culinary arts, for ‘Outstanding Bar Program’. The new collection has a mix of masculine, yet sleek designs that would instantly upgrade any area of your newlywed home (even if you live in a 450 square foot apartment like I do).  END
BEGIN HERE Some of my favorites from the new barware collection include the 5-Piece Shaker Set at a perfect wedding gift price point of $100 and the elegant Bar Tray. For the more adventurous couple, I love the Smoking Box with Cocktail Smoking Gun, which allows you to essentially infuse your cocktail with a delicious smoky taste. This collection is a definite DO for engaged couples, and would also make for wonderful holiday gifts. I like to consider barware the gift that keeps on giving!  END
BEGIN HERE    1. Combine all ingredients together in a Crafthouse by Fortessa mixing glass.    2. Stir with a Crafthouse by Fortessa bar spoon.    3. Chill cocktail as cold as possible.    4. Garnish with flowering lavender & mint blooms. END

BEGIN HERE  Whether you want to vacation among the fashion elite, celebrate your new marriage with a major shopping excursion, or simply check Italy’s most glamorous city off your bucket list, we recommend adding Milan to your honeymoon to-do list. It may not be filled with as many ancient monuments as Rome or have the small-town charms of Florence, but Milan is not without its merits. Chief among them: its status as a major fashion capital and its unique positioning as the gateway to don’t-miss northern destinations, like: Lake Como, Venice, Portofino, the Dolomites, and more. Here’s how to discover the best of the city in a long weekend: END
BEGIN HERE    For your last night in Milan, the city is your oyster: If you’re feeling fancy, head to the Bulgari Hotel Milan for dinner. There, you’ll find the new Dom Pérignon Lounge & Raw Bar—that’s right, an entire bar serving every Dom Pérignon Champagne imaginable (if you’re there on Wednesday or Thursday, you’ll also get a DJ spinning live tunes in the background). If you want something low-key, try Ristorante A Santa Lucia, on Via S Pietro All’Orto. The old school restaurant, founded in 1929, is supposedly the first pizzeria in Milan, and has hosted famous names like Josephine Baker and Liza Minnelli; so expect to end your trip in good company—in addition to your new spouse, of course. END
BEGIN HERE If your bridal style is more Princess Diana than Kate Middleton, then a vintage wedding dress may just be a way for you to reflect your unique sartorial style. Though it may take a bit of digging, a vintage frock is a great way to ensure that your dress isn’t like anything your other engaged friends are wearing — often for a much more affordable price. Make sure to regularly check these Garden State second-hand shops for their bridal offerings to track down the old school dress of your dreams. END
BEGIN HERE ‘Tis the season to eat, drink and be merry! Whether you’re celebrating your first Christmas as a married or engaged couple or you’re just in a serious relationship that’s headed down that same road, we’re here to help you get in the spirit of the holidays and make it magical. After all, there’s no time like the present, so start creating those precious holiday memories and traditions now. END
BEGIN HERE    Volunteer at a school, shelter, church or other place where you can help spread holiday joy, recommends Doares. “You can also adopt a child from an angel tree together or shop for Toys for Tots and make it a new tradition.” Giving back is what the season is truly about after all. END
BEGIN HERE Baby, you're a firework. Oh wait, that's just the shine coming off of Katy Perry's new ring... with its giant diamond... on her left ring finger. Hold up — we need to a do a double take on this one.  END
BEGIN HERE Engagement rumors have been swirling around Katy Perry and her beau of the moment Orlando Bloom practically since they snapped their first public pic together at January's Golden Globes after-party. That's almost an entire year of Are They? or Aren't They speculation! But Perry's new bling that has recently taken up residence on that oh-so-special finger has us hoping that these two are once-and-for-all officially engaged. There's no denying that Perry's ring (photos below) has all the makings of a bridal bauble. And if it looks like an engagement ring and shines like an engagement ring, that's what it has to be, right? Right?! END
BEGIN HERE The "Rise" singer and her actor sweetheart were spotted out and about in New York City earlier this week and, as hard as it is to miss this good-looking pair, it was even more difficult to miss the massive ring Perry was rocking.  END
BEGIN HERE According to Entertainment Tonight, the couple enjoyed date night at the swanky Polo Bar, with Perry accessorizing her plaid patterned jumpsuit with her giant oval-cut diamond ring, featuring a unique yellow hue and thick halo. "She walked with her left hand leading her, and bent her hand to show off the large sparkler to the cameras," an eyewitness dished to Entertainment Tonight.  Flaunt it, Perry! END
BEGIN HERE "Katy's mood was better than [I] had seen before," noted the source. "Katy was happy and laughing, joking with Orlando and pals as they got into the car. [Katy and Orlando] seemed proud to show off their happiness." Post-engagement bliss, perhaps? Their mile-wide smiles coupled with that sparkler definitely has us hearing wedding bells! END

BEGIN HERE Picture it: You're having the best time with your fiancé picking out barware, kitchen items and more wedding registry must-haves for your newlywed home when suddenly, you see the most to die for handbag. Your inner voice is telling you it’s totally fine to scan and throw onto your registry, but your fiancé is not so into it. Er, what's a bride-to-be to do? Well, there’s one basic guideline to keep in mind when deciding whether including a “personal” item is totally okay or a total faux pas. END
BEGIN HERE “Registries should be personal,” says Jennifer Spector, Zola director of brand strategy and newlywed-at-large. “Guests love you and want to celebrate you, so adding personal items benefits you both. At the same time, registries should be considered part of the wedding, so avoid personal items that are not connected to this special time. That's what birthdays are for!” END
BEGIN HERE That said, not all unique registry items are verboten. Read ahead for some personal items you can totally get away with including on your wedding registry. END
BEGIN HERE    If you’re a big wine-lover or foodie, you may want to keep the good times rolling even after your big day. (So when food and cake tastings are done-zo you won’t have to stop indulging!) That’s where a wine subscription or meal plan can come into the picture. If it fits your personality, don’t sweat it — your guests will get where you’re coming from, experts say. “Your registry is an opportunity to showcase your taste as a dynamic duo, and also to fill your home with gifts and experiences you will really use,” Spector says. “Your guests (hopefully) know you well enough to connect with what you registered for, whether it be camping equipment or a restaurant dining subscription.” END
BEGIN HERE Wedding registries make it easy for guests to shop for gifts, making sure they’ll pick something you’ll love. But while websites and brick-and-mortar stores are convenient for guests who live in the U.S., it can be a challenge for international guests. Should you set up an additional registry that will be easier for international guests to access? Here’s what our experts have to say. END
BEGIN HERE The great thing about most registries these days is that they’re accessible 100% online — meaning not only can you put the entire registry together without stepping into a store, your guests can do all their shopping from home, too! So even if  your guests live abroad, they should be able to shop from your registry with no problem. If you’re concerned about a language barrier between your registry and your guests, ask a family member to serve as translator and help your guests navigate the process. This is also helpful if you’ve set up a honeymoon or other cash fund, as these are definitely more popular in the U.S. than abroad. Your family can help explain the concept, as well as either walk your guests through the process or facilitate sending another gift or a check, instead.  END
BEGIN HERE Another perk to using the same registry, no matter where your guests are from, is shipping. Sure, selecting gifts from an international website may make it easier for your guests, but if you live in the States, they’ll be stuck paying hefty international shipping fees to get the gift to you, whereas purchasing something from a U.S.-based registry site, even if they live abroad, means the gift will come from a warehouse in the States.

BEGIN HERE Congratulations are in order for actor and actress duo Ben McKenzie and Morena Baccarin, who are engaged! The Gotham stars were spotted in NYC this week with a new sparkly accessory. Spoiler alert: We are LOVING Baccarin's engagement ring. END
BEGIN HERE The couple attended the 26th Annual Gotham Independent Film Awards at Cipriani Wall Street on November 28, 2016 in New York City, according to E! Online and Baccarin, 27, debuted her new sparkler. McKenzie, known for his recurring role on the hit series The OC was all smiles, and his new fiancé was flashing her new bling. The engagement ring, which appears to be an oval-cut or pear-shaped diamond with a pave band, was front and center in many a photo — with the Brazilian-American actress rocking a taupe-brown manicure to offset the ring. END
BEGIN HERE The couple, normally quite private, styled it up for their night out. The groom-to-be wore an Alfred Dunhill suit while his bride-to-be wore a Monique Lhuillier dress and Neil J. Rodgers shoes (perhaps foreshadowing her dress pick for the big day, eh?). Baccarin, most well-known for her Emmy-nominated role in Homeland, met her groom-to-be in 2014 on the set of FOX's Gotham.  END
BEGIN HERE During the film awards, McKenzie weighed in on Gotham's midseason finale, noting, "It's very dramatic: Lots of blood, lots of guns going off, and a marriage as well. So, a little something for everyone." Sounds like McKenzie's on-screen and off-screen lives are colliding (minus the blood and guns). While he didn't divulge much about their upcoming nuptials, it was pretty obvious that the two excited for their big day. END
BEGIN HERE The couple welcomed a daughter into the world in March, naming her Frances Laiz Setta Schenkkan after McKenzie's mother. "I love that name. We call her Frankie." the actor said on Harry last month. As any proud parent would, he added that she's "the cutest thing." This will be McKenzie's first marriage and Baccarin's second marriage. Previously, she was married to Austin Chick, who fathered her 3-year-old son, Julius Chick. The two split in 2015 and share custody.  END
BEGIN HERE As far as their little Frankie, the couple shared their sentiments with E! on the red carpet about her 8-month-old status. "She's about to crawl. We're dreading that," McKenzie laughed. "But she's great, and it's wonderful to have family around and celebrate the holidays together." Engaged and a crawling baby at the holidays? Sounds like they'll be having quite a fun December. END
BEGIN HERE The perfume scent you wear on your wedding day holds a special place: not only will it take you back to that moment every time you wear it, but just like the venue, flowers, and overall décor, the right fragrance can heighten the ambiance of your wedding. So, how to choose the right one? When it comes to perfume scents, citrus blossoms and rose will play nicely against the backdrop of a garden; at a vineyard, succulent fruity scents like fig and blackberry with warm notes of cedar wood and musk are ideal. At the beach, try fresh, clean scents with hints of mint and basil, and in the city, go for the simple elegance of white florals and green leaves. Below, the perfume scents we're currently loving — inspired by your wedding venue location. END
BEGIN HERE She's a mom, duh! Ok, well maybe not yet, but word recently broke that Means Girls actress Amanda Seyfried and her fiancé Thomas Sadoski are expecting their first child together!  END
BEGIN HERE Seyfried's publicist just confirmed the happy news to USA TODAY after the actress showed up to a Givenchy event on Tuesday in a rather revealing sheer black dress that just so happened to show off her ADORBS baby bump. Seyfried, known for her roles in Dear John and Mamma Mia!, obviously looked chic with her signature smoky eyes and a pretty diamond engagement ring poised on her hip as she struck a pose for the camera. She attended the event — with her baby belly in tow — to show support for the fashion house as the face of Givenchy's new Live Irrésistible fragrance. END
BEGIN HERE It seems like just yesterday Amanda Seyfried was celebrating her engagement to actor Thomas Sadoski, doesn't it? Well, that's probably because it happened back in mid-September! The two met while working on the off-broadway play The Way We Get By last year, and later reunited on set for the upcoming film The Last Word. Sadoski decided to keep things simple with the engagement ring he chose, opting for minimalism over opulence. He ended up purchasing a thin and delicate sliver band, because really, who needs a ton of diamonds anyway.  END
BEGIN HERE And even though it's every girl's wish to marry her Prince Charming, it seems Seyfried got another one of her wishes granted this year. In August 2015, she told E! News, "I need to get on it...I want a child. Badly. I want to be a mother, badly. That's what I feel." And they say only fairy godmothers can make dreams come true... END
BEGIN HERE But now let's discuss what we're all really wondering — will the baby news push back these lovebirds' wedding date?! We know they just got engaged in September buuut after Seyfried announced her distaste for white wedding dresses, we're super impatient to see which color she'll choose for her big day. We're selfish, we know! END

BEGIN HERE Mark your calendars, y'all! The date of the next Kardashian wedding extravaganza has reportedly been set. So you best begin preparing yourselves for all of the flower walls, towering wedding cakes, and six-figure budgets, because Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna's wedding date is apparently not too far off! BRB, checking our mailbox for an invite... END
BEGIN HERE Kardashian first slipped that dazzling diamond engagement ring on his bride-to-be's finger back in April, and since then, we've been anxiously awaiting the day they tie the knot. Now, we have a pretty good idea of just when that might be! According to In Touch, Chyna and Kardashian are set to wed on — drumroll, please... — July 17, 2017. A summer wedding? Yaass! END
BEGIN HERE After all, we all know that the Kardashian ladies look ravishing in white (remember Kim K's bridesmaid dresses?), so if Chyna plans on recruiting her to-be sisters-in-law for bridesmaid duty, we're predicting an all-white summer wedding for this bride and groom. But, allegedly, summer wedding style isn't the sole reason behind why Chyna and Kardashian chose to tie the knot on July 17. According to the gossip mag, the date actually holds a special meaning for the reality TV pair. "The number seven is Rob's lucky number, and he's extremely superstitious, so picking a date was very important to him," a source revealed. END
BEGIN HERE The insider also dished that Kardashian had originally wanted to get married on his birthday, March 17, but after giving birth to their little one earlier this month, Chyna wanted more time to get her bod wedding-ready, leading them to push back their "I do" date by a few months. "The date was a compromise, but Rob doesn't mind," explained the source. "He’s just excited to marry the woman of his dreams." END
BEGIN HERE While we're firmly in the camp that believes that all body types are wedding dress ready, we totally understand Chyna wanting to look and feel her best on her wedding day. However, if you ask us, Chyna already looks pretty darn good, post-baby! Since giving to birth to her and Kardashian's daughter, Dream Renée Kardashian, on November 9, Chyna has been steadily shedding for the wedding. Just this Saturday, the star took to Snapchat to reveal that she's already lost a whopping 23 lbs. so far! "39lbs go away!!!" she wrote on the post. "Lost 23lbs so far!!! Goal 130 post baby weight." END
BEGIN HERE  How Kanye West Tried to Sabotage Kim Kardashian's Wedding to Kris Humphries END
BEGIN HERE At this rate, Chyna will be hitting her goal weight way before her wedding date. Think that means these two could be tying the knot even soon? Fingers crossed! END
BEGIN HERE Every year, the average age that women are getting married creeps up a little bit. Depending on whom you believe, it's because women are going farther in their careers, we're opting to have children later in life, and/or because we don't feel the same pressure to get married in our early 20s, the way our own parents did. END
BEGIN HERE I believe that's probably all true, but I think women (and men) have benefited from the more relaxed lifestyle choices today. It's almost expected for a couple to live together before exchanging vows. And that time together makes us wiser as we grow older. We don't make rash decisions in the hopes that we'll like living and making a life with somebody. Most of us try it out first, to make sure it works. END
BEGIN HERE The fact that more women are getting married in their mid-to-late 30s changes the demographic of who is attending a wedding, when the bride and groom are closer to 40 than to 20. Take a look at your guests list — if most of your guests are in their 30s or above, understanding the following five things may make your wedding planning more pleasant. END
BEGIN HERE  This is your wedding, and just because you didn't rush down the aisle years ago doesn't make it any less special. Those are the folks you don't need to include in your wedding party, even if you were in their weddings 10 years ago. Surround yourselves with the friends and family who are as pumped as you are about the impending wedding. END

Incorporate foil letterpress in silver or gold for a classic tone and your guests will be certain to experience fictional fairytale wanderlust as they open your stationery. Consider adding the phrase "Love, laughter, and happily ever after," to your cocktail napkins, welcome kits, signage, or favors for a dose of magic. For extra subtlety, consider a simple engraving inside your wedding bands. END
BEGIN HERE If the phrase “Asset Management Conference” doesn’t immediately make your heart skip a beat, Christine Ong Kashkari and Neel Kashkari’s story might just leave you feeling otherwise. After all, that’s where this twosome met in the summer of 2012, and after a year of bi-coastal dating, they were engaged and living together in California. But where would they tie the knot? “We loved the idea of getting married at a California state park," the bride says. "California has been home to my husband for over a decade, and he’s had a cabin he loves up in the mountains of Tahoe for over a decade.” END
BEGIN HERE The question quickly became, "How do we transform one of the nations most beautiful parks to become a wedding venue?" The answer was by not doing much!  With a sprawling lawn, distant mountains, and picturesque Lake Tahoe all on the grounds, Hellman Ehrman Mansion at Sugar Pine Point Park in California put this bride and groom way ahead of the game when it came to breathtaking wedding décor. “We wanted to work with the natural beauty of the place,” Christine explains. “We didn’t want to transform it, but just to enhance it” And so, on August 15, 2015, with planner Scott Corridan there to create a space that was somehow both effortless and awe-inspiring all at once, Christine and Neel became husband and wife. Lucky for us, Melina Wallisch Photography was there to capture it all.  END
BEGIN HERE While many brides search near and far for their wedding dress, Christine found the perfect gown right in the comfort of her own home. "I saw my dress online, where I do 90% of my shopping, and it was that wonderful mix of contradictions that gave it such a unique appeal for me," she says. "Vintage-inspired yet contemporary. Demure but sexy.” After trying on just one other gown (another online buy!) it was clear that the first Monique Lhuiller wedding dress was the winner — and for good reason. The romantic silk gown featured sheer lace sleeves and an elegant short train. For some added drama, the simple silhouette was enhanced with a gorgeous scoop back and intricate lace detailing.  END
BEGIN HERE “My mindset going in was that there’d be a million dresses that I’d love and it would be so easy to get distracted and confused with the many, many options out there.” she says. "I think if you have a good sense of the look or feel you’re trying to achieve, and a strong understanding and appreciation of what looks good on you, it would help immensely in finding a dress to match your style inspiration and budget.”   END
BEGIN HERE When it came to accessories, Christine kept things simple, wearing only the vintage-style diamond earrings gifted to her by Neel when they first started dating. As for her shoes, anyone who’s ever been to an outdoor wedding knows the right footwear makes all the difference, and this bride nailed it with leather and lace Nicholas Kirkwood sandals that had a stacked heel. “They were perfect for walking in a park,” she says.   END
BEGIN HERE The bride held a hand-tied bouquet of peonies, roses, dahlias, and a few sprigs of lavender, all wrapped with a strip of burlap. The natural arrangement perfectly complemented the day’s organic feel — and its soft, neutral colors lent a romantic note to the venue’s otherwise rustic elements. END
BEGIN HERE For his outfit, the groom wore his favorite blue suit and a silk Canali tie, a gift from Christine. While Neel’s western-style boots look might seem like a fashion-forward choice, the bride admits that her groom's choice of footwear was never up for consideration. “Unlike me, my husband only wears three kinds of shoes: black shoes for work, tennis shoes to the gym, and boots to go out.” END
BEGIN HERE With a spectacular view of Lake Tahoe as the ceremony’s backdrop, the couple didn’t have to do much in terms of décor. But we’re so glad they did. Guests sat on either side of a petal-strewn aisle that led the way to a wooden arch covered in greenery and white flowers.  END
BEGIN HERE The bride walked down the aisle with her father, who wore a traditional Philippine Barong Tagalog to reflect the family’s Chinese and Philippine ancestry. A formal shirt weaved from pineapple leaf fibers, it’s easily one of the most unique father-of-the-bride looks we’ve seen.  END
BEGIN HERE Instead of reciting traditional vows, the couple enlisted the help of friends and family to recite a few selected readings, including a poem entitled “The Lovely Dinosaur” by Edward Monkton. While the ceremony provided some of the most heartwarming moments of the day, it also provided some of the funniest. “We put the rings on the wrong hand initially, but corrected it with the officiant declaring the wedding still valid to everyone’s laughter,” Christine says. END
BEGIN HERE With the ceremony complete (and official!) guests made their way to the mansion’s garden where antique furniture was placed throughout the lawn. A combination of upholstered loveseats, chairs, sofas, and futons provided charming and comfortable areas for guests to mingle.  Everything from marble stands to tree-stumps served as end tables, making the space feel at one with nature. An especially inventive detail? Birch branches that doubled as both table décor and escort-card holders.  END
BEGIN HERE In the very center of this open-air celebration stood a single free-standing wall, complete with crown molding, shelves, and ornate picture frames that looked clear through to the other side. This inventive “photo-booth” was a hit among guests and we love the way the quirky snapshots became part of the decoration.   END
BEGIN HERE During the reception, guests sat at long wooden dining tables decorated with simple linen runners. Low arrangements inspired by the bride’s bouquet were placed in glass vases on every table along with lanterns of varying sizes and materials. Crystal glasses and neutral colored dishes with a minimalist border completed the look. To ensure their seats stood out, the bride and groom decorated their chair backs with a lush green garland studded with flowers.  END
BEGIN HERE The entire area was sectioned off by string lights and hanging crystals — a brilliant way to ensure the area looked festive both day and night.    Rather than treating seating as just a numbers game, Christine and Neel took great care in deciding where their friends and family would sit. “We made extra effort to make sure we were thoughtful in seating guests together and that we not only had a good mix of his and my friends and family, but that they’d have an interesting and complementary set of experiences and background to encourage lively conversation," the thoughtful bride says. "It was honestly such a pleasure to hear from a lot of people independently how much they enjoyed their table.”  END
BEGIN HERE As with any reception, music played an important role, but this couple’s selection hit a little closer to home. “We had a live jazz band playing before the start of the ceremony and after. We both love jazz music and always catch a jazz show whenever we’re in New York.”  So it was The Turnaround Jazz Quartet from San Francisco that had guests up and dancing all night. END
BEGIN HERE Dessert always makes our eyes grow wide, but this time it wasn’t just because of our sweet tooth. Illuminated by candles under a moonlight sky, this dessert table was a showstopper in it’s own right. The couple's white, three-tiered cake was decorated with pinecones and ribbon.  END
BEGIN HERE All in all, it was a gorgeous night capable of making even the most hardened city-slicker wish they were more of an outdoorsy-type. With such an unbelievable setting, it’s easy to assume the planning process would have been overwhelming, but Christine’s advice to future brides makes it feel within reach. “Keep it simple, authentic, and true to yourselves,” she says.

This purse is fashioned with a drop-in chain strap, so you can wear it in-hand or over your shoulder. Rows of crystals and gold chains add a retro-glam vibe that's perfect for festive affairs. (Crystal and chain clutch, $170, Sondra Roberts available at Nordstrom) END
BEGIN HERE These stellar pumps are sure to standout with mini, midi and maxi silhouettes alike. The sparkling star detail adds a touch of whimsy. ("Twilight Princess" pumps, $865, Charlotte Olympia available at Bergdorf Goodman) END

BEGIN HERE Chances are, if you're anything like us, you still remember waking up (or staying up) at the wee hours of the morning to absorb every single detail of the royal wedding. Obviously the bridal detail that stuck out the most was Sarah Burton's custom-made wedding dress from the Alexander McQueen label that perfectly transitioned regular civilian Kate Middleton to her Duchess of Cambridge status. Even still, the gown is influencing bridal fashion all over the world. We're beginning to see more long, lace sleeves head down the runway, and models sporting gowns with more "ladylike" simple lines. END
BEGIN HERE But now, almost five years after Princess Kate said her "I dos" to Prince William in that dreamy dress (and picture-perfect wedding ceremony), the designer of that iconic gown — which will hereby be known as "the dress" for all of eternity — is currently under some cringe-worthy heat with the law. The head of designer label Alexander McQueen is being sued for purportedly stealing and copying designs from British bridal designer Christine Kendall of Hertfordshire, The Sunday Times reports. END
BEGIN HERE The Sunday Times explains that Kendall had sent wedding dress ideas to Kensington Palace for Middleton's review before the wedding had taken place, and she reportedly had received a note back from the office of Prince William and Prince Harry thanking her for the sketches. END
BEGIN HERE "Miss Middleton was most interested to see your work and very much appreciated you taking the trouble to write," the letter said. But according to a spokesperson for the Duchess of Cambridge, her royal highness had never even seen the wedding dress sketches. END
BEGIN HERE As more details emerge, it's plain to see that this is going to be one hot, and possibly nasty, debate between the designers. END
BEGIN HERE    A spokesperson for Alexander McQueen replied to the lawsuit by telling CNBC, "We are utterly baffled by this legal claim. Christine Kendall first approached us at Alexander McQueen almost four years ago, when we were clear with her that any suggestion Sarah Burton's design of the royal wedding dress was copied from her designs was nonsense. Sarah Burton never saw any of Ms. Kendall's designs or sketches and did not know of Ms. Kendall before Ms. Kendall got in touch with us — some 13 months after the wedding. We do not know why Ms. Kendall has raised this again, but there are no ifs, buts or maybes here: this claim is ridiculous." END
BEGIN HERE The British fashion designer feels otherwise. Her lawyer told The Sunday Times, "Our client is certain that her company's design was unfairly taken and copied. The claim is not against the Duchess and there is no allegation of wrongdoing against the palace." END

BEGIN HERE Choosing a maid of honor can be tough. It gets even tougher if the woman you chose is having a tough time fulfilling all of her duties, whether it's because she's underage and can't really help with your bachelorette rager or she just had a baby and has her hands full. So if your maid of honor has a lot on her plate, can you appoint an honorary MOH to help out? Here's what our experts think. END
BEGIN HERE Being appointed maid of honor is a real, well, honor, and many brides choose to save the title for the closest gal in their life. But if you've got a close runner up, you can definitely ask her to take on some of the MOH responsibilities, as long as you're upfront (and sensitive!) about it. END
BEGIN HERE If your maid of honor is under 21, there's a good chance she won't be able to take care of everything on the MOH to do list, partially because she isn't old enough to join you at bars on your bachelorette weekend, and partially because she might not have the funds (or the connections with your other bridesmaids) to make big plans. In this instance, tapping an honorary maid of honor is totally understandable. Turn to your closest friend (who probably knows your sister just as well as she knows her own!) to either tag team with your maid of honor or take on the duties herself. END

BEGIN HERE Rebecca Melton admits that she and John Carlo Heywood searched long and hard to find each other. "John Carlo had gone on over a hundred first dates in four years and I had committed myself to at least 10 hours a week of online dating," Rebecca says. "Finding each other wasn't just a long process, it was also grueling and disheartening." Although neither thought their first date was a success, they decided to give it another try — a decision that proved to be worthwhile. After just three months of dating, John followed Rebecca from New York City to California for a job transfer and the rest was history. On July 6, 2014, John proposed while on a picnic at a little park on the top of Nob Hill, and Rebecca happily accepted. END
BEGIN HERE The pair looked at several San Francisco venues for their May 23, 2015, wedding, but in the end, they chose the James Leary Flood Mansion. "It has lots of old-world detailing and a grand yet light and airy feeling," the bride says. "Plus, it had a courtyard for our ceremony and amazing views of the bay." They tapped Emily de Ayora of Downey Street Events to help them plan an elegant, dream-like celebration with lots of spring-inspired details. Annie McElwain Photography was there to photograph every special detail — from the bride's stunning ball gown to the flower-filled reception. END

Her Allure Bridals ball gown, complete with a sheer-illusion back and neckline, an embroidered bodice, and slight cap sleeves fit perfectly with the regality of their wedding venue. END
BEGIN HERE She accessorized her soft updo with a beaded clip and donned delicate drop earrings. Her only pre-wedding attire regret? Not trying on veils with her wedding dress. "The first one I ordered ending up being too short and was a last-minute headache to exchange for a longer one," Rebecca says. END

BEGIN HERE Her bouquet was an absolute stunner. Rebecca carried a round, loose arrangement of peonies, Juliet and David Austen garden roses, ranunculus, sweet peas, queen Anne's lace, and greenery in various shades of pink. END
BEGIN HERE Rebecca's bridesmaids wore off-the-rack T-Tahari floral jacquard dresses with an embellished neckline. Each carried a bouquet similar to the bride's, with a mix of roses, ranunculus, lisianthus, astilbe, and jasmine vines. END

BEGIN HERE The couple's outdoor ceremony was held in the venue's courtyard. "The mansion has a series of arcaded windows and a balustrade with urns at the ends," Rebecca says. "We put large flower arrangements in the urns and a beautiful spray on the transom above the central set of French doors. No one had ever put flowers up there before according to the venue staff!" END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Annie McElwain Photography    END
BEGIN HERE Rebecca and John chose not to write their own vows ("I didn't think I could keep it together to say them," the bride says) but did personalize their ceremony in a few different ways. First, a friend recited e.e. cummings' "I carry your heart with me." Then, after the couple exchanged rings, they asked all of their guests to join them in singing The Turtle's "Happy Together." "We were a little nervous as the officiant, DJ, and wedding planner had never had a couple sing a song during the wedding, but it worked out great!" says Rebecca. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Annie McElwain Photography    END
BEGIN HERE The party then moved inside to the mansion's main hall, where two rows of long tables were set to seat Rebecca and John's 126 guests. There, loved ones were treated to an incredible floral sight: Arrangements of tall and short blooms spanned the length of each table, made up on roses, garden roses, peonies, lisianthus, ranunculus, stock, jasmine vines, hydrangeas, and anemones. "We had a ton of flowers. One guest joked that four days before our wedding, every flower in Ecuador was cut," says the bride. END
BEGIN HERE The result was stunning and well worth the effort. The couple, their planner, and florist all decided that alternating high and low arrangements was the ideal way to keep conversation flowing between guests. Place settings were an elegant combination of a gold-rimmed white charger topped with a floral-patterned china plate. Gold flatware, crystal stemware, and pale aqua linens finished off the look. END
BEGIN HERE Rebecca and John's chairs were decorated with trailing swags of fresh flowers, including peonies, roses, and ranunculus. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Annie McElwain Photography    END
BEGIN HERE The couple's first dance was one to remember. Rebecca, a professional ballroom dancer, and John, who loves to tango and swing, both felt strongly about making their moment special. So the bride taught her groom the classic Viennese Waltz and took an elegant twirl to "So This Is Love" from Cinderella. END

BEGIN HERE Leave it to a supermodel to take a picture-perfect ring selfie! Australian fashion industry darling Nicole Trunfio and musician Gary Clark Jr. are fresh off their wedding day bliss and are officially in their honeymoon phase, after their April 19 Coachella-inspired wedding. But it sure doesn't look like Trunfio will be sick of her brand new bridal bling anytime soon. In between canoodling with her new hubby (we assume...), the cover girl can't help but post some snapshots of her wedding ring on social media. But with bling that beautiful, can you really blame the girl? END
BEGIN HERE Just last week, Trunifo and Clark said their "I dos" at a Coachella-inspired wedding (which paid homage to their music festival meeting four years ago) in Palm Springs, and gave BRIDES an exclusive first look at their rocker wedding — including everything from the bride's Steven Khalil beaded ball gown, the decadent desert venue, the A-list wedding singers, and all those flower crowns. While we're still swooning over their boho-chic wedding photos, Nicole still seems to be starry-eyed over the newest addition to her ring finger — her wedding band. END
BEGIN HERE We knew the model's engagement ring was a stunner. In fact, it's hard to tear our eyes away from Trunifo's impossibly sparkly cushion-cut diamond. That thing is just plain huge, after all! But her to-be-wed bling is definitely getting a run for its money now that it's sitting beside Trunifo's just-as-luxe wedding band. END
BEGIN HERE The newest — and by far the most important — addition to Nicole's jewelry box is a thin and elegant pavé diamond band that perfectly complements her supersized engagement ring. The Australian beauty posted her latest ring selfie to Instagram just yesterday and those diamonds couldn't be more dazzling. Captioned with the lyrics to "Feeling Good" by Nina Simon (Trunifo also looked to the artist for her and Clark's reception music selection!), she let her meaningful bling take center stage as they glittered in the sunshine. "Wifemode," the newlywed also hashtagged the too-pretty pic. END

BEGIN HERE  62 Wedding Ring Photo Ideas for Your Big Day END
BEGIN HERE Blocking off part of your wedding week schedule for primping and pampering is an excellent idea! Spoiling yourself, if you've got all your wedding homework accomplished and are ready for the big day, is a great way to get in the mood for being "Princess for a Day" that weekend. END
BEGIN HERE Unfortunately, not every beauty treatment out there gives you immediate results, and some of them are not intended to do so. The wrong timing of certain spa treatments can leave you wishing you hadn't tried to spoil yourself — sort of the no-good-deed-goes-unpunished philosophy. END
BEGIN HERE   This is the time to invest in the pricier mani and pedi options at the spa. Paraffin dips help moisturize and defeat the ashy look skin can get in a dry climate. Callous removal on your feet will make those fantastic wedding shoes look and feel much better as you dance the night away. And if you have rough, dry hands, what better time to do as much triage as possible so your hands feel soft to your fiancé when you stand before the officiant to exchange vows? Plus, literally everybody will be checking out your hands to see the new wedding ring. END

BEGIN HERE In the world of sparkling wine, champagne has always been the king of the castle. But in reality, champagne is just a name that can bring along with it an unnecessarily extra-large price tag. END
BEGIN HERE Alternative sparkling wines, which are often made exactly the same way as champagne, have been growing in popularity and are super hot in the world of wine right now. Save yourself some money while serving something that wine snobs and leisure-drinkers alike will love. Whether a beautiful bottle of Portuguese espumante or Napa Valley sparkling, these are some of the most trending, interesting, and delicious sparkling wines perfect for any budget and wedding style. END
BEGIN HERE   Champagne isn't the only region doing great sparkling in France. If you're going to break out of the traditional champagne mold and want something that's unique and memorable to serve to your guests, we say go all the way and make a statement with a French sparkling rosé. Not only will its beautiful deep pink make for a playful pop of color, it's a great way to bend the rules and make it you. For a fruit-forward sip with a super stylish, hip bottle, we love the l'unique gas de shiste by Château de la Liquière, especially for warm weather weddings. END

Don't let the stress get to your head though. Here are 6 ways to decorate your home on a tight budget without, you know, sacrificing style or the aforementioned quality. END
BEGIN HERE   Out with the old, in with the new! If you just moved in together and even if you didn't, you probably have a bunch of stuff still in boxes you're, well, not that into anymore. Instead of hiding it away in the garage or trying to find a place for it in the new spot, why not gather up all your "junk" and have a big yard sale? You'll then be free to decorate with a clean slate and have some extra cash on hand to buy the things you really want. It's a win-win! END
BEGIN HERE Looks like LeAnn Rimes and Eddie Cibrian are on honeymoon round 2! As the Hollywood duo celebrates five years as husband and wife, they're also showing off their beach bodies from a romantic anniversary vacation with friends in Cabo San Lucas. In addition to using the marriage milestone to flaunt her rockin' bod and post some epic throwback photos, Rimes also received a "happy anniversary" message from an unlikely source... her now-husband's ex-wife, Brandi Glanville! END
BEGIN HERE Rimes took to social media to share moments from their romantic rendezvous with fans and followers. While hanging out on the beach with her lady friend, Rimes showed off both of their killer figures in an epic bikini photo. "Best Beach Babies!!" the 33-year-old country singer wrote on Instagram. END

News reports, in an Instagram video his loving wife posted to Instagram as well. "This is so happening. #whiteboys #isthatcalleddancing #waiterproblems." END
BEGIN HERE Rimes and Cibrian's actual anniversary was on Friday, and the couple shared many sentimental and heartfelt notes on their social media channels as well. "Happy 5 year anniversary to my lover, my friend, my heart, my everything!" Rimes wrote with a throwback photo from their wedding day. "We have walked through hell and back to be together and wouldn't change a thing. Our bond is like no other. I cherish you!" END
BEGIN HERE Rimes posted a few other sweet snaps to Instagram to mark the occasion, referring to her wedding as her "best day ever" in one throwback photo, and even posted an ultra retro pic from the first time they met. "I was 14, he was 23. We don't remember meeting. He found this in the garage while going through boxes. 14 years later who knew we'd meet again," she wrote alongside the photo. "Crazy, all the life that happened between those two encounters, the lessons that needed to be learned. Fate? Chance? Serendipity? Who knows ? All we do know is, here we are together and tomorrow we are celebrating 5 years of being married and we wouldn't want to be anywhere else. " See the cute snaps below. END
BEGIN HERE The couple married in April 2011 in an intimate Malibu wedding after having a much-publicized and headline-making affair, which ultimately lead to the split of Cibrian and his ex-wife, Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Brandi Glanville, Us Weekly reports.. Despite the drama and controversy surrounding these three, Glanville still took to Twitter to wish them a happy anniversary: "@leannrimes Happy anniversary Happy 2watch my boys 4 mybaby daddy so that y'all can celebrate! Get a tan for me #feeling pasty (mean it)." END
BEGIN HERE To which the singer responded: "@BrandiGlanville Thank you! Happy that we always pick up where the other leaves off. Xoxo" END

BEGIN HERE It looks like spring is finally sticking around for a while, and for all its scenic and stylish benefits — an al fresco rehearsal dinner, an outdoor ceremony, a backless chiffon dress — the change of weather has prompted a symphony of sneezes and sniffles for thousands of brides-to-be who suffer from allergies. Chances are your seasonal allergies are nothing new, but after chatting with the pros, there are some fresh ideas and precautions you can take that make itchy eyes and irritated skin a little more bearable if your dream is to have a spring wedding.

"Eucalyptus, lavender, and mint shower gels are great for opening up the sinuses. Malin & Goetz has amazing, relaxing options.

BEGIN HERE With all the details, checklists, payments and correspondence involved in planning a wedding, one might find it hard to call wedding planning "fun." Here at BRIDES we know wedding planning can be extremely stressful and nerve wracking, but we're here to help. Here are some of our favorite tips on how to make wedding planning fun. (Yes, it is possible!) END
BEGIN HERE   Creating your own centerpieces? Need help with making seating charts? Whatever the task may be, as long as you trust others can handle it, invite friends over and make a night of it. (Bridesmaids totally come in handy here!) Turn on some good tunes, and reward your helpful friends with some cocktails, appetizers or sweet treats as a way to show your appreciation for their help. END
BEGIN HERE Wedding are almost always stressful for the bride-to-be. (A big duh on that one, right?) Between dealing with nightmare vendors, an endless to-do list, and dozens of details, pre-wedding jitters always seem to plague about-to-be-wedded ladies. But they're not alone in their aisle anxiety — even the tiniest members of the wedding party could be feeling the pressure! As a flower girl in an upcoming family wedding, 4-year-old JoJo Lomelino is definitely feeling the weight of her important nuptial role. And according to a Youtube video where the pint-sized flower girl is explaining the ins and outs of wedding etiquette to her father, it sounds like JoJo is certainly taking her wedding duties very seriously. END
BEGIN HERE Weddings are serious business here, people! The last thing you need is a wedding guest trying to distract from the bridal party walking down the aisle. Apparently, no one knows this better than JoJo, who is determined not to let anyone — not even her dear old dad — take away from her big moment. "You don't know what weddings look like," this sassy flower girl says to her father in the video clip. "You can't talk to people, okay," she explains. "You have to remember. You can't call my name when I'm going to be walking down the aisle. No one can call us because we're going to be busy walking down the aisle." You might think JoJo is just being cute, but trust us — some wedding guests really do need to be told this... END
BEGIN HERE According to the Huffington Post, JoJo's dad is actual a pastor who knows a thing or two about weddings. But still, the man just can't help himself. "What if I just yell 'Princess?'" he joked. "No!" wails JoJo, exasperated. "Because dad, there's going to be a bunch of people sitting, and then they're just going to hear us, and they're going to be like 'Why were you doing that? That was a dumb person.'" We're with you on that one, JoJo. That would pretty much be our reaction to any ceremony outbursts, too. "You do not understand weddings at all," she says, giving up on her hopeless pops. END
BEGIN HERE To be completely honest, we wish all bridesmaids took their wedding duties as seriously as this little flower girl. In fact, we call for JoJo as maid of honor! The girl deserves an upgrade and chances are, she'd definitely be able to wrangle any flaky wedding vendors into submission... END
BEGIN HERE  7 Things Only Former Flower Girls Know About Weddings END
BEGIN HERE One of the biggest decisions in the wedding planning process is the wedding dress — which can range anywhere from hundreds of dollars to thousands of dollars. But when it comes to Live! With Kelly and Michael host Kelly Ripa, her wedding dress was pretty special to her, so special, in fact, that she recently brought it to wear on her 20th anniversary vacation with husband Mark Consuelos. END
BEGIN HERE Once you can get over the green-eyed envy that her wedding dress that still fits 20 years later, here's the clincher: it was only $199 dollars! Ripa shared with People that she didn't stress like most brides when it came to picking out her white gown — it was actually already hanging in her closet. END
BEGIN HERE "The story behind the dress is I bought it at the Barney's Warehouse sale," she explained. "The dress is 25 years old. My marriage is 20 years old. I didn't buy it as a wedding dress. I just bought it because it was really pretty, and I wanted to buy something from the Barney's Warehouse sale. I was working on the soap. I didn't make a lot of money. It was $199 on final clearance sale. 'Do I eat this week, or do I get this dress.' Literally, this was the thought process." END
BEGIN HERE She clearly picked correctly, since she's wearing it 20 years later. "I said to myself, 'I bet if I buy this maybe it will be an investment piece. Maybe I will wear it more than once.' I swear to you I wear it constantly. It's a beach cover up now. I wear it all the time. It was the best $199 I ever spent in my life." END
BEGIN HERE Her hubby, however, didn't go with a timeless piece, and opted for a more trendsetting late-90s look at the time. END
BEGIN HERE "Mark's outfit — I have to tell you, my dress really stood the test of fashion time better than his outfit," she noted. "I don't even remember what he was wearing. It was like a white linen jacket with a black shawl collar. He looked a little Travolta-y. In a good sexy way, but in a very of the moment, of the time way." END
BEGIN HERE   The Live! With Kelly and Michael star just returned from her 20th anniversary vacation with Consuelos this week. This work hiatus stemmed from a previously tumultuous week on her talk show — in which she took a few days off due to her co-star, Michael Strahan, announcing to the network and viewers that he was leaving for Good Morning America. The former New York Giants star and Ripa came out this morning holding hands, and she jokingly acknowledged on-air that "our long national nightmare is over." She went on to say how she views the Live! team as her second home and family. "We have an incredible team and we are devoted to one another. We are family." END
BEGIN HERE The color scheme you choose will play a big role in dictating your wedding's déor and ambiance. Looking for a moody vibe? Opt for rich wine hues, accented with gold. Going for a light and fresh garden party feel? Soft pastels are right up your alley. But when it comes to choosing the details, don't feel confined to solid colors. Instead, add texture and personality with prints and patterns that combine the shades you love. The finished product will be perfectly cohesive, but with an extra dose of visual interest that will make a serious statement. We spoke to wedding pros from around the country to round up some of their favorite ways to mix prints into your wedding — check out the ideas they love, below! END
BEGIN HERE   Randi Smith of Sugar Euphoria loves using patterns and prints to make a wedding cake anything but standard. "It's an amazing way to translate various aspects of your special day — like colors, floral designs, and other motifs — onto your cake." And while embossed fondant, expert piping or a flurry of rosettes will give you a patterned look, she takes it a step further, actually printing edible motifs that can be layered onto fondant or buttercream for a look that's truly unique. A cake wrapped in love letters? We're in! END
BEGIN HERE It's the most glamorous, most meaningful, and most expensive piece of clothing you will ever own — and the sad truth is you get to wear it for only one magical day. While we all wish we could throw it on a mannequin and stare at it every day for the rest of our lives, sadly something has to be done with your wedding gown once you've become a Mrs. Luckily, there are tons of options — from traditional to innovative — to help you decide what to do with your wedding gown once you're a newlywed. END
BEGIN HERE   For those with an artistic eye and open mind, a less-traditional option would be to destroy (artistically, of course) your gown and capture it on film. Many photographers offer post-wedding photo shoots that include jumping into oceans or pools in your once-treasured gown, frolicking through the mud, splattering it with paint or glitter, and more. Our advice? If you're thinking about jumping on the "trash the dress" trend, we strongly recommend finding a photographer who has experience with this endeavor. Just like you can only wear it once, you can only trash it once! END
BEGIN HERE You may recall Angela Simmons from the popular TV show Run's House (which featured her hilarious, post-Run DMC dad turned motivational speaker via his bathtub) which aired on MTV from 2005 to 2009. Or maybe you recognize the 28-year-old from her current show Growing Up Hip Hop with Romeo Miller on WeTV. While remembering her for her TV stardom is totally fine, we bet that next time her name pops up on your computer screen it won't be a reality show that comes to mind, it'll be her stunning engagement ring which has us — and soon you — completely fan-girling. END
BEGIN HERE The massive solitaire sparkler was shown off on Simmons' Instagram page in a video that will no doubt give you permanent heart eyes. As she slowly moves her hand back and forth — with freshly painted pink fingernails, of course — the diamond sparkles like the ocean on a sunny day. Ahh, #ringgoals. Simmons captioned the video by saying, "YES!! I couldn't be more excited. This is only something I could of only dreamed of. I'm over the moon and feeling so blessed to be able to share my life with the one I truly love. Everything happened in the most perfect way." END
BEGIN HERE "But HOW did it happen, Angela?!" we scream internally into the abyss. As for the man who popped the question, well, that's when things get even murkier. END
BEGIN HERE Fans and followers of the Run's House star were completely caught off guard when Simmons announced her engagement on the social media site, even though many wished her kind words of congratulations anyways. But some weren't afraid to voice their confusion. One user commented on the video saying, "She was dating someone?" While another user, ashanaa_, wrote, "Who's the lucky boy?" END
BEGIN HERE That's the question that has us stumped. So who IS the main man in Simmons' life? A photo posted a few weeks ago to her Instagram somewhat points us in the right direction. In the picture, Simmons is piggyback riding on who we assume is her forever love. She wrote, "My one and only #MCE. The true definition of a MCE...One who truly has your back. #TrueLove #Thankful." END
BEGIN HERE Sadly, we don't catch a glimpse of the lucky man's face, but we can say he's well-equipped in the muscle department. Until we find out who Mystery Man is, we'll be just fine googly-eyeing over Simmons' drop-dead gawgeous ring. END
BEGIN HERE And hey, at least Rev. Run approves! END
BEGIN HERE The tiniest members of your wedding party may be the cutest, but they can also be the most volatile. After all, you probably won't see a bridesmaid having a temper tantrum about putting on her dress, but a three year old flower girl who missed her nap due to the excitement? It happens more than you'd think. So what's a bride to do if that meltdown happens right before everyone's supposed to head down the aisle in your wedding ceremony? Here's what our experts have to say. END
BEGIN HERE First, see if there's something that can be done to calm the child down. Would walking down the aisle with mom or dad cure a case of stage fright? Offer that as an option, especially if the parent in question is in the wedding party — it will seem like you planned it all along! Or would a sweet bribe (something that won't melt, like gummy bears) do the trick? Pull out every trick you have to see if it will solve the problem. END
BEGIN HERE If no amount of pleading or negotiating will help (and if you've got an over-tired, hungry, or overwhelmed toddler, there's a good chance nothing will), you might need to go to plan C and "fire" the little tyke. Stash the basket of petals, tuck the ring into the best man's pocket, and send the bridesmaids and groomsmen down the aisle as planned. Then pause for dramatic effect at the end of the aisle, wait for your processional song to start, and head to the altar. END
BEGIN HERE Of course, you'll still want to capture some of the cuteness in photos. If the flower girl or ring bearer has calmed down by the time the ceremony is over, include him or her in your pictures alongside the bridesmaids and groomsmen. It will be a great story to tell in 20 years at their wedding! END

Refaeli recently posted a bare baby bump selfie on her Instagram and it's all kinds of cute. END

It may come as a shock to many of their fans who have been following their engagement since November of last year when Peretti posted a short-but-sweet tweet saying, "My fiancé (lololol) Jordan Peele proposed to me last night during the family talent show lolol." Apparently the comedians — one a Key & Peele alum, the other a Brooklyn Nine-Nine star — wanted a BIT more privacy than their celeb status would allow, so instead of throwing an extravagant, Kardashian-style wedding they eloped!

BEGIN HERE Taking on that bridesmaid role has an infamous reputation for a few reasons. One reason has to do with the potentially less-than-flattering (but not always!) bridesmaid dress you may have to zip on for your walk down the aisle. The other main, and head-shaking reason, is that being a bridesmaid can be expensive. You may be asked to shell out money on things you never knew were part of your bridesmaid duties and you may find yourself wondering if being a bridesmaid in the future, is something you can afford to do. So before you say a big yes to the bridesmaid dress, take note of the four things you will be asked to pay for as one of the bride's go-to gal pals for her wedding day. END

BEGIN HERE And this wasn't just any pony, it's a rescue horse named Cajun, who is the second equine in the Tatum stable. Their first horse's name is Smoke, also known for his affinity to beer, according to Cosmopolitan, whom the Tatums adopted last summer. Talk about saving a horse and riding a cowboy! (Lol.) Props to Mrs. Tatum on the thoughtful gift. END
BEGIN HERE The 36-year-old actor spent his birthday weekend with his wife, daughter Everly, and pup Lulu in the woods — where Dewan-Tatum gave her hubby his milestone gift. From the looks of their Instagrams (see the cute photos below), it seems the weekend was filled with family time and lots of love. "'To love someone deeply gives you strength. Being loved by someone deeply gives you courage.' — Lao Tzu HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MY LIFER," she shared in her photo. END
BEGIN HERE Dewan and Tatum have been married for over six years after meeting on the set of Step Up in 2006. The two are constantly gushing about each other. "She keeps us all sane," Tatum said of their relationship. "Jenna, she puts everything in perspective for me always. I'll find myself spinning out or angry or whatever or even happy and she always somehow ends up somehow riding the ship in some very interesting way." END
BEGIN HERE And because he's just that adorable, Tatum even let his daughter paint his face green this weekend, snapping a video of it. "Braveheart paint by Evie, new rescue horse named Cajun on a sunset ride. Thanks for all the birthday wishes," he wrote on the 'gram. Yes, the birthday boy should get lots of presents and love on his birthday, but we're now waiting for our gift — a little rendition of his "Pony" dance from Magic Mike, please and thank you. END

BEGIN HERE It's hard not to become overwhelmed as a bride-to-be. Juggling guest lists and scheduling wedding dress fittings can start to weigh on your shoulders, which is why it's important to destress before you walk down the aisle. We spoke to a handful of experts for some slightly non-traditional ways for brides-to-be to unwind before the wedding. END
BEGIN HERE  The Two Best Workouts for Stress Relief END
BEGIN HERE You've already decided who gets a plus-one to the wedding, and your bridesmaids and groomsmen all made the cut. But your wedding party is attending a lot more than just the wedding, so should their dates be invited, too? We asked our experts whether or not your bridesmaids and groomsmen's plus-ones should be added to the rehearsal dinner guest list. END
BEGIN HERE When you're making the guest list for your rehearsal dinner, the only people you need to invite are those who are participating in your rehearsal, which probably includes your immediate family, your wedding party, and any friends or family members who are doing readings as part of your ceremony. Inviting anyone beyond that is a nice touch, but isn't required. END
BEGIN HERE However, if you're planning to invite additional people to join you at the rehearsal dinner, the dates and plus-ones of anyone who is participating in the ceremony should be the first people you add to the list — including your wedding party, siblings, and other family members. Since you're inviting your wedding party along with their dates to your wedding (whether married, dating, or just friends), that means they'll probably be in town the night before, too. Avoid the awkward situation that would leave your bridesmaids' boyfriends and husbands to fend for themselves for dinner (as well as any resentment from your bridesmaids!) by including everyone in the dinner plans. END
BEGIN HERE You don't, however, have to invite them to the rehearsal itself. Having additional people hanging around can be distracting and might prevent your rehearsal from running smoothly and quickly, so ask all the plus-ones to meet up with you at the restaurant, once the logistics are taken care of and you're ready to start celebrating. END
BEGIN HERE  Do Bridesmaids Have to Attend the Rehearsal Dinner? END
BEGIN HERE Choosing linens for your wedding registry can be a tricky business. Oh sure, you probably know what size beds you have (or will have) and what kind of bedding you need or want. And it's a great time to re-evaluate whether the towels you've had since college belong in the rag bag. Finally, you can register for something plush and lovely that matches the color scheme in your bathroom. END
BEGIN HERE Choosing table linens can be far more difficult, and not as much fun if you're not sure exactly how you'll be decorating your new home. Most young couples do not have much in the way of a table linen selection before they get married. Maybe some fabric napkins and placemats, but nothing that you'd keep forever, and definitely nothing that must be ironed, right? Your wedding registry is a great time to fill out your supplies for when you want to entertain to impress. END
BEGIN HERE Do you have a good dining room table, or do you plan to replace or upgrade yours? If the one you're eating on now isn't the one you want to own, do you know what size and shape you want to get eventually? Will it be round, oval, or rectangular? If you haven't the slightest idea, you may want to postpone requesting tablecloths as gifts. Perhaps an attractive table runner that compliments the room would be a better selection. END
BEGIN HERE You can choose fun placemats and napkins to create a pretty table-top if the table itself isn't hideous, and doesn't need to be camouflaged. Your wedding is a great chance to register for lovely dinner napkins and placemats with your monogram on them — just make sure they're made of a type of fabric you'll be able to work with later on. END
BEGIN HERE Class up a simple cocktail party with linen napkins, monogrammed or not. Your guests will definitely look twice — just be sure to drop them in the OxyClean before you head to bed or they'll be one use only. END
BEGIN HERE Monogrammed tea towels for your kitchen, and hand towels for the bathroom can be a very classy addition to your home. Yes, you probably got hand towels that match your bath towels, but that doesn't mean you can't have special ones you put out when you're expecting company. END
BEGIN HERE  Real Brides Reveal Their Biggest Wedding-Registry Regret END
BEGIN HERE Registering for high-quality monogrammed napkin rings — something you'd probably never buy for yourself — will also make for a fun, eye-catching detail on your dinner table, no matter which linens you use. END
BEGIN HERE And don't forget, your wedding registry is a good place to register for special holiday linens, too, if you plan to be hosting Thanksgiving or Christmas in the near future. Think about the beautiful tables you saw when you were a child, and channel one of those looks. It'll be fun. END

BEGIN HERE No matter how wildly in love you are now, says Lesli Doares, marriage coach and author of Blueprint For a Lasting Marriage, you can always fall deeper. Ready to take an even bigger plunge? Here's how. END
BEGIN HERE   How important is it to share a giggle with your spouse? According to Doares, "It's been found that laughter is more important in a relationship than sex." Whoa. Here's why this simple activity can deepen your love: "It is a shared state of joy which every relationship can benefit from," Doares explains. "It also provides protection against anger and resentment, the relationship killers." END
BEGIN HERE Luann de Lesseps may be losing her countess title with her upcoming wedding, but by throwing in the crown, she's getting some pretty hefty bling in return! Back in February, the Real Housewife of New York became engaged to businessman Thomas D'Agostino and she couldn't help but flaunt her new supersized engagement ring all around town. (Could you really blame the woman?) And now de Lesseps is spilling all of her upcoming wedding plans — and, despite the fact she'll no longer be a countess, her ultra-lavish nuptials sounds totally fit for royalty. END
BEGIN HERE The reality star certainly does have a lot to celebrate come her big day, which she's planning to have on December 31. "You know what, it's threefold," de Lesseps explained to Entertainment Tonight. "It's Tom's birthday, he's going to be 50, it's our wedding, and it's New Year's Eve." Well, a party like that certainly calls for some head-turning attire, if you ask us! So what's a one-time Countess to do? Get herself three wedding dresses, of course! END
BEGIN HERE Although the former model said that she's still in the early stages of her wedding plans, she knows that she wants three — count 'em, three! — wedding dresses for that walk down the aisle. "For my big night, why not have three different dresses?" asks de Lesseps. Well, we certainly can't think of a good reason not to... "I'm gonna work and collaborate and design one myself, because I love style and fashion. I've styled myself for the last eight years of the show," she said, referencing her always-stylish RHONY persona. END
BEGIN HERE While de Lesseps still hasn't decided if she's going to extend wedding invites to her Bravo cast-mates ("Let's see how the ladies behave at the reunion," she slyly says), it sounds like this bride-to-be couldn't be more excited to tie the knot once again. "I'm a hopeless romantic," de Lesseps admits. "I knew I wanted to get married again, I kind of put that out in the universe, and it came true. I'm just as shocked as you are. I'm shocked and thrilled." END
BEGIN HERE Best of all? Luann isn't letting something as silly as a new marriage license stop her: "You can always call me the Countess," she promises. Phew, what a relief, you guys... END
BEGIN HERE  This Real Housewife's Daughter Just Got Engaged! END
BEGIN HERE Its no secret that many brides use the time before their wedding to tone up and reexamine their diets in an effort to be the best versions of themselves on their wedding day! But aside from diet and exercise, a third important component of health is often overlooked — vitamins. Whether you're looking for stronger, shinier hair or an increase in energy and overall health, consider adding these vitamins to your pre-wedding health routines. END
BEGIN HERE   No bride has time to get sick. Vitamin C helps to support your immune system to fight off infections by promoting the repair and growth of tissue throughout your body. Commonly found in broccoli, citrus, potatoes, spinach, and berries, Vitamin C also helps to heal wounds and block free radicals. (Nobody wants scars or bruises on their big day!) END
BEGIN HERE Remember, when considering increasing or adding vitamins to your daily consumption, you should always look for natural food sources before adding supplements. Also, be certain to speak to your doctor before adding or changing any aspect of your health routine. END
BEGIN HERE Lauren Cherry and Stephen Harber have known each other for their entire lives — literally! Their families have been friends for as long as each can remember and the couple has photos together dating all the way back to pre-school. When they became close friends in high school, no one was surprised that the relationship transitioned into more the summer before their senior year. They went on their first date to see The Dark Knight and officially became a couple on August 14, 2008. After six years of dating, Stephen proposed on the beach in Cozumel and Lauren happily accepted. END
BEGIN HERE The two Georgia natives knew they wanted a wedding in their hometown, and that their June 12, 2015, celebration had to be indoors. "Atlanta in June is hot and I wanted an open space that had an industrial feel that I could really make my own," Lauren says. Summerour Studio, right in the heart of Atlanta, was just what the couple wanted: An industrial space with a romantic twist thanks to wooden floors, walls covered in ivy, and skyline views. The space quickly guided their dreams of an industrial garden party, and Leah Economos of EEP Events helped the bride and groom bring that vision to life. Read on to see how it came together, as photographed by Harwell Photography. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Harwell Photography    END
BEGIN HERE "We wanted the wedding to feel like a romantic garden with the contrast of metal beams and old windows," Lauren says of Summerour Studio. "I wanted the evening to be fun and really be a reflection of Stephen and me and what we like." The bride and groom didn't go into planning with a set color palette, but Lauren noticed one naturally evolving. Pinks, cream, and green ended up ruling throughout the ceremony and reception, and red and orange were noticeably absent. "I have red hair and those colors do not work for me," Lauren laughs. "I feel crazy saying that out loud." END
BEGIN HERE The crafty bride created all of the couple's wedding stationery and went bright and bold with their hand-painted invitation suite. "My favorite part of wedding planning was painting all of our save-the-dates and invitations," she says. The result was a personalized and poppy selection of stationery, complete with a quirky illustration of the bride and groom. END

"I knew exactly what I wanted my dress to look like, but could not find it anywhere, so we got in touch with Terry and she created it for me." After trying on over 100 gowns in salons and boutiques, Lauren knew there were tons of beautiful options out there, but none that really spoke to her. So, with Terry's help, the bride walked down the aisle in a tulle, illusion netting, and lace modified ball gown. Complete with a sheer high neckline, low back, and fluffy skirt, Lauren could not have been happier with the beautiful silhouette. END
BEGIN HERE As a last minute decision, Lauren decided to wear her mother's gorgeous veil, complete with delicate lace applique. "I'm so glad I decided to do it. It was long and beautiful and the touches of lace matched my dress," she says. END

BEGIN HERE Times are a changing and so are bridal showers, apparently! So if you're not the type of bride who wants to sit and play cheesy (albeit sometimes fun) games all day or open up wedding gifts in front of a big audience, rest assured you've got options, girl. From full-bar parties with the boys to calligraphy classes to dance parties, here are six modern bridal shower ideas both you and your guests are sure to get a kick out of. END
BEGIN HERE   After sitting through hours of gift opening and tea and sandwiches for friends' showers, nowadays many brides are choosing to do something completely different when their turn rolls around, notes Tracie Domino, founder of Tracie Domino Events. And for good reason too! "We're seeing less daytime female only events and more events in the evening to honor the couple with their friends and family of both sexes, often with a full bar, catering and entertainment," she says. "In many cases, the couple doesn't even open the gifts to keep the energy of the party going all night." As a guest, we can say this is one type of shower we'd totally be down to attend! END
BEGIN HERE 'Twas the night before the Royal Wedding and all through Kensington Palace, not a creature was stirring... Well actually, quite a few creatures were stirring, namely Kate Middleton, busy with all that Royal Wedding prep work and bidding farewell to her single gal days. It's crazy to think that Friday will mark five years since Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge became formally known as Kate Middleton and wed Prince William in the fairytale affair of the decade. But to celebrate the royal couple's upcoming anniversary, we're throwing it back to the Duchess' final days as a bride-to-be. Come on, we really can't be the only ones wondering what an about-to-be princess does for a bachelorette party, can we? END
BEGIN HERE Something tells us this is one bachelorette bash that definitely didn't include any strippers in the festivities, but even royalty should be able to send off their Miss title in style! So about a month before the big royal wedding, Middleton's sister and maid of honor, Pippa, pulled off a super-secret bash for the bride-to-be, according to People. To keep the paparazzi on their toes, the maid of honor booked the girls' night out at four different venues around London, including the uber-trendy Eighty-Six restaurant, and also planned a Dirty Dancing-themed fête at their family's home in Bucklebury. A Dirty Dancing theme?! Anyone mind if we steal that idea? END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Giphy    END
BEGIN HERE But alas, we were right in the assumption that no royal strippers were invited to the party. "Kate's very well-aware the spotlight is on her," said British wedding planner Sarah Haywood. "The slightest slip-up wouldn't go down well." Her bash might have been Dirty Dancing-themed, but in that case, we're guessing that Middleton didn't spend her final single days dancing on any tables with her bridesmaids! END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Giphy    END
BEGIN HERE Another huge part of the Duchess of Cambridge's last few days as Kate Middleton? Tons (and we mean tons) of bridal beauty prep! Her night-before preparation included a trip to the luxe Jo Hansford Salon for a manicure. "She wanted something off-white and bridal," remembers her manicurist, Marina Sandoval. So after a hand exfoliation and deep-tissue massage (rough day, huh Kate?), Sandoval blended a few polishes, including Bourjois' "Rose Lounge" and Essie's "Allure" to create a custom shade that complemented the bride-to-be's skin tone to a tee. Forget a royal wedding, customized nail color is enough to get us giddy! END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Giphy    END
BEGIN HERE The Duchess is known for her bouncy and beautiful envy-worthy hair, and getting those locks wedding ready was certainly no easy feat. According to the royal wedding hair stylists, James Pryce and Richard Ward of London's Richard Ward Salon, Middleton went through two hours of some pretty intensive hair prep the night before her "I do's," which consisted of a wash, blow dry, and curl setting to prepare for her complicated bridal beauty style that had to take one very important factor into consideration. "The focus of the style was Catherine's unique and individual halo-style tiara, set just back from the hairline, which determined the finished look," a representative of the Richard Ward Salon told People. Definitely something not all brides-to-be have to be concerned about... END
BEGIN HERE But the major takeaway from the Duchess' last few single gal days? "She didn't display an ounce of nerves," remembers Sandoval. "She was just happy that the day was here at last." END
BEGIN HERE And if we remember correctly, so were the 2 billion people who tuned in to watch those memorable "I do's!" END

BEGIN HERE Lace! 3D Florals! Down-to-there necklines! Sexy sheaths! Spring 2017 Bridal Fashion Week was a whirlwind of beautiful wedding dresses ready to suit even the most fashion-savvy brides.  END
BEGIN HERE Hundreds of gorgeous gowns paraded down the runways at Bridal Fashion Week for the lucky brides getting hitched in the coming seasons. Here, 16 wedding dresses our fashion director, Eleanor Strauss, went nuts over. END
BEGIN HERE From the traditionally ornate, to silk and sultry, the dresses that came down the runways at Bridal Fashion Week were nothing short of spectacular. 2017's brides-to-be you're a lucky bunch, your wedding dress choices are a combination of ethereal, modern, romantic, and ornate. From Carolina, to Monique, Oscar and Naeem, designers showed collections blooming with springtime inspiration. Dramatic bows, beautiful beading, and delicate fabrics make these 16 dresses so special, I couldn't help but swoon. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Indigitalimages.com    END
BEGIN HERE Oversized bow details were rampant on the runways, and one of my favorite trends of the season. Seen at Carolina Herrera (left) and Oscar de la Renta (right) they made for show stopping backs to otherwise traditional dresses. Talk about an exit! END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Indigitalimages.com    END
BEGIN HERE I also loved the myriad of long sleeves that were present this season. At Naeem Khahn (right) and Angel Sanchez (left) they were done in embroidered perfection. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Indigitalimages.com    END
BEGIN HERE We love a big bold opulent bridal moment, and few did it better this season than Marchesa (right), with oversized 3D florals, statement jewels, and hints of blush. Delphine Manivet is always a favorite and this gown had modern-day Gone With the Wind written all over it. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Indigitalimages.com    END
BEGIN HERE Elie Saab's debut bridal collection (left) was filled with decadent bridal details — from intricate lace to feathered shoulders. While shades of blush dominated the runways, I loved Houghton's modern show and this dress was ethereal perfection. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Indigitalimages.com    END
BEGIN HERE Illusion bodices and cut-outs continued strong this season. And I'm not complaining, just look at the detailing that went into J.Mendel (left) and Lela Rose's (right) versions. END
BEGIN HERE      Photo: Indigitalimages.com    END
BEGIN HERE Call it the Frozen effect! Ice princesses were all over the collections, with a Midsummer Night's Dream Twist — like at Mira Zwillinger (left) and Monique Lhuillier (right). Maybe more woodland nymph than ice Queen. END

BEGIN HERE The last thing you want to think about while you're planning your wedding is divorce, but sometimes life happens. It's hard to think about the end of a marriage while you're starting yours, and it's even harder if the person who is getting divorced is someone close to you, like a bridesmaid. If you do find yourself tasting wedding cake in between distraught late-night phone calls and tense trips to the lawyer's office, what should you do? Our experts have a few tips. END
BEGIN HERE You've chosen your bridesmaids because of the close, personal relationship you share, and it's a relationship that goes both ways. So while no one wants to deal with a friend's divorce during their engagement (or really, any time), make sure that you're reciprocating that friendship as much as possible. END
BEGIN HERE Talk to her about how much she wants to be involved in your wedding planning. It's an emotional and difficult time for her, so she may opt to limit how much the two of you talk about your plans — or she might be in desperate need of a happy distraction and could cherish the chance to pore over napkin choices or shop for honeymoon bikinis. Let her guide you and dictate what she's comfortable with, versus assuming that anything wedding-related is off-limits. Again, it's a friendship that goes both ways, so she'll want to be there for you, too, if she's feeling up to it! END
BEGIN HERE Make sure to set aside time to spend one-on-one, whether that means dinner at your favorite wine bar or a Saturday night on the couch watching chick flicks. Offer to accompany her to her lawyer's office (or court, if need be), as well as to help with little things like picking up dry cleaning. Be as supportive as possible! END
BEGIN HERE When it comes to your actual wedding day, offer to give her ex's spot on your guest list to a friend or family member she'd like to celebrate with. If you're close with her ex, as well, have a serious conversation about whether or not to keep him on the guest list. Chances are you'll have to rescind his invitation, so be prepared for that conversation — and keep it as civil as possible. END
BEGIN HERE And if it seems like she's just too overwhelmed, be prepared that she may decide to back out of bridesmaid duties altogether. END
BEGIN HERE  9 Daily Habits to Divorce-Proof Your Marriage END
BEGIN HERE If it weren't for Iggy Azalea's abundance of love — and a strong (ok, elementary school level) grasp of the English language — her  L.A. Lakers fiancé, Nick Young, would probably be VERY permanently embarrassed right now. According to cringe-worthy, albeit hilarious, tweets posted by the Australian rapper, her hubby-to-be got thiiiis close to having the words "BORN REBLE" be forever etched into his back. Luckily, he has a fiancée with a heart of gold who decided to intervene at the last second and set things straight. Ok, sort of... END
BEGIN HERE As noted in one of the artist's tweets, she at first considered not even flagging the major ink oopsie. She admitted, "I was going to be petty and not say!" But when it comes to true love, Azalea decided not to ruin her beau's back at the expense of a never-ending joke (although she did wind up posting a photo of the NBA star's near-mishap on Twitter for all of her fans to see!). END
BEGIN HERE You may be wondering why the Australian celeb would even consider allowing such a catastrophe to happen, but we have a feeling it may have something to do with the nasty rumors circulating around the web. OR, as People points out, it may have a little something to do with the word "Becky." END
BEGIN HERE If you've been hiding under a rock for the past week, you may be confused as to what relevance the word "Becky" has in all of this. Well, after Beyoncé came out with her visual album Lemonade this past Sunday, the Internet literally imploded over who in the world the woman "Becky" could be. Seriously, just Google it. But apparently the Lakers player ended up calling his bae "Becky" after she took a stance against being called "Becky." So, what better way to seek revenge than to post an embarrassing photo of your fiancé? END
BEGIN HERE Moral to the story: don't even dare messin' with the realest. END
BEGIN HERE Long gone are the days of boring wedding toasts and speeches, and this one is no exception. When your maid of honor throws on giant sunnies and a fur coat for her toast, you know you're in for a good ol' Grammy-worthy performance. This MOH sang a unique rendition of Adele's Top 40 hit, "Hello," for her wedding toast — making the crowd go bananas — in this hilariously funny wedding video. END
BEGIN HERE With the rest of the bridal squad as backup dancers, this maid of honor began her dramatically original version of "Hello," sharing the couple's inside jokes for the wedding reception guests, reports Pop Sugar. "Hello couple of the night, my bridesmaid's dress is way too tight. I remember when we all took a look and saw that you two made it official on Facebook," she crooned (surprisingly on-key) to the captivated audience, who was giggling away. END
BEGIN HERE The bride's leading lady definitely hit a home run, nailing her performance and hitting the major maid-of-honor speech musts: keeping it short and sweet, addressing the groom, having a good time, practicing beforehand, and poking fun — but leaving out R-rated embarrassing moments. END
BEGIN HERE This just goes to show that major bridal-party-performance planning is a thing, and there's a lot of pressure on the maid of honor and best man to 'wow' with their speeches. Whether you blame The Voice, Glee, or the two bridesmaids' hysterical wedding toast that went viral, there's a big trend emerging — the song mash up to roast the bride and groom. END
BEGIN HERE And while the real music video has Adele holding a flip phone and tea, this maid of honor kept it low-key by only adding a few props to her ensemble — albeit cheeky and personal lyrics that had the crowd in hysterics. "Let me tell you how these two are for sure meant to be — they both have the same feet; they love to laugh, they love the Bills, and of course their favorite place is Tracy's [Bar]. It's no secret that Romer wears Baby Gap t-shirts," she sang to a room of chuckles. At the end, she even asked the crowd to stand up and dance and clap along. END
BEGIN HERE Right on cue after her line, "wait — does this mean Romer is my brother for life? Oh God, why?" followed by a mic drop, she rounds it all out with a few sweet and sentimental lines about the couple. Clearly this isn't her first rodeo in the entertainment department. The perfect MOH speech, if we do say so ourselves. Bravo! END

BEGIN HERE Make no bones about it: the first date is crucial. Ask any bride-to-be, newlywed or woman who's been married for 45 years how she met and fell in love with the man she chose to marry and you're bound to get an adorable, if not hilarious, recount of their first date. And for President Barack Obama and Frist Lady Michelle Obama, it's no different. Their first-date story is so cute, in fact, that someone made a movie about it. And that movie, Southside With You, looks just plain delightful. END
BEGIN HERE The trailer for the upcoming John Legend-produced historical rom-com about Barack and Michelle Obama's first date was released Thursday, April 28, and this movie looks sweeter than we could have imagined.

BEGIN HERE In the trailer, a reluctant Michelle Robinson, played by Tika Sumpter, gets ready to head out of the house to attend a community event with Barack Obama, played by Parker Sawyers, who happens to be a young associate at the firm where she works.

BEGIN HERE Throughout the day — which includes a picnic, long walk, tour of the Art Institute, a viewing of the Spike Lee movie Do the Right Thing and, of course, that community meeting (we're already exhausted) — and into their epic daylong date, Michelle continuously insists that their time together is "not a date." Yeah, okay Michelle. END

BEGIN HERE The long tables were topped with arrangements of roses and greenery, including evergreen branches collected from around the property. Candles were placed in birch candlesticks, which were handmade by Kate's father. "He used birch from our yard, and stamped every one of them," she says. END

BEGIN HERE During wedding planning, there are so many choices and options that need to be decided — from table linens to floral combinations to beauty options. So, when it comes to honeymoon planning, it may be the last thing on your mind — though often the most memorable. Honeymoon destinations range from total relaxation to ultimate adventure, making it difficult to decide where to go. But what about when you need a combination of relaxation and adventure? When it comes to that combo, look no further than the beautiful Caribbean island of Saint Lucia. Here are 5 must-do activities if traveling to this romantic island for your honeymoon. END

BEGIN HERE   For those wanting a more 'hands-on' experience — sampling offerings indigenous to Saint Lucia — start the day with the Tree to Bar Experience, a local plantation that offers excursions which include picking your own cocoa beans, and thoroughly partaking in the local chocolate creation process from start to finish. For the spirits-lovers, take a trip to one of Saint Lucia's rum distilleries while tasting the island's finest sweet liqueurs. A plethora of rum is created on the island, so it's more than likely you'll be imbibing some during your stay — and will come home with a little extra knowledge (and palate) for the process.

BEGIN HERE We might still be awaiting (and not so patiently, we might add...) the newest season of The Bachelor to see if the third time's the charm for Nick Viall, but we just got a sneak peek at one of the group dates of the upcoming season — and it's a '90s girl dream come true! The ladies and Viall just headed to the IHeartRadio theater for the recent Backstreet Boys concert, where The Bachelor cast took the stage. Because what's a date without a choreographed group dance, right? END
BEGIN HERE Who needs a trip to Jamaica? This is our version of a fantasy date! The season 21 contestants — in matching outfits, of course — and Viall attended the Backstreet Boys concert and slayed the stage (see video below), according to E! News. After the Backstreet Boys performed "Everybody (Backstreet's Back)," the concert got a reality show twist when the ladies began performing a choreographed group dance around their sweetheart. END
BEGIN HERE But the performance wasn't just a surprise treat for the audience — it was a competition amongst the contestants! At the end of their performance, the Backstreet Boys themselves practically took on rose ceremony duties by choosing a winner of the dance-off. The prize? A sweet slow dance to "I Want It That Way" with Viall as the other contestants watched from the sidelines. Our past teenage selves are SO jealous right now... END
BEGIN HERE   "You're like my personal Ryan Reynolds," Backstreet Boys member A.J. Mclean joked to Viall. "Not only is Nick handsome, he can move." If we weren't already looking towards the upcoming season, we definitely are now! END

BEGIN HERE You get an inkling the proposal's imminent. Or you're been talking about it for months, and you can sense that your guy's close to pulling the trigger. Suddenly, your mood nosedives. You become a nervous wreck. Your mind races and you feel really anxious — about everything. This is SO not how you expected to feel on the eve of your marriage proposal, and yet you do. END
BEGIN HERE Why? Once you know that the proposal is in fact coming, you're finally free to take the focus off of "Will he ever propose?" The result: You now have the mental and emotional space to consider the consequences of said coveted proposal. END
BEGIN HERE It can be a whirlwind processing through all the changes in your identity and relationships this imminent proposal will cause: What's it like to be a fiancé? To plan a wedding? To become a wife? How's your mom going to react? Your dad — can he handle it? How will your single girlfriends respond? (You remember the jealousy and sadness you always felt when another friend got married and you don't want to cause them that pain.) Who's going to be in your bridal party, and what does that say about your friendships? What does it mean to have him become your husband? To link your life forever with this great guy (who, because he's a human being, has all these annoying and difficult qualities as well)? With his family? What's it actually like to be engaged and get married? END
BEGIN HERE In short: How is this going to change my life? END
BEGIN HERE These are worthy and important questions to ponder, consider, and work through. Doing this emotional work can make you feel anxious, sad, scared, and overwhelmed. It's all normal and necessary to help you make the psychological transition from single woman to married woman. END

BEGIN HERE You and your fiancé love to cook, and while you were registering you found that perfect set of knives. Only problem? It costs $800. Do you add it to your registry in hopes a few friends will go in on the set together? Or do you look for a cheaper model? This is a common conundrum for newly-engaged couples shopping to complete their first home together. You want to outfit your kitchen, bedroom, and living spaces with quality products — but you don't want to be a burden to your guests' wallets. So what do you do? END
BEGIN HERE   If you have high-end taste and you know it, strongly consider where it is that you register. While department stores may sell those ultra-nice pots and pans you want — so might another store, like Bed, Bath and Beyond, that is more likely to have sales and coupon codes. If you're worried an item is too pricey, having a discount-friendly retailer might be the key to making it more affordable for your friends and family. END

BEGIN HERE   The pair kept their ceremony décor simple, opting to tie the knot beneath a wooden arch decked out with neutral-hued flowers and lanterns. The reception mixed the two styles, too. Lindsay and Kyle chose lace-wrapped vases to hold their baby's breath centerpieces and covered a mix of round and long tables with white linens and low glowing candles. END
